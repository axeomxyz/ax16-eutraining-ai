The candidate starts off by providing the context to the regulation of batteries and waste batteries in the status section in a well-written and concise fashion. This section illustrates strong potential in presenting key issues with clarity and cohesion. 

However, some further background/overview of the legislative situation could have been added. 
E.g.:
“In December 20XX-2, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on batteries and waste batteries.”

Could have had more clarity in expressing the purpose of the memo. 
E.g.:
“The purpose of this memo is to launch the interservice consultation procedure for the new Regulation on Batteries and waste batteries. It is intended to structure the review of the original proposal, considering the observations of the Council and the European Parliament, and to further materialize the specific requirements by setting measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based targets and objectives.”

The further sections of the memo omit several key issues and data concerning the topic. 

It could also have been structured in a clearer and more coherent way. The information thus seems disjointed and impacts the flow and readability of the document. For a manager with limited understanding of this area, it would be difficult to gain a complete picture of the topic and the interconnectivity of the issues. 

The Agenda section is far too concise. It could still use subheadings and bullet points but also should expand on the key points. 
E.g.: 
1. General points
The new regulation should apply to all batteries including all waste portable batteries, electric vehicle batteries, industrial batteries, starting, lightning and ignition batteries, and batteries for light means of transport (e.g., electric bikes, e-mopeds, e-scooters).
2. Supply chain of raw materials
3. Production of batteries in the EU
4. Functioning of the internal market

Overall, the memo leaves the impression of being a work-in-progress.

The document is structured very well into clear sections where relevant information can be found.

The first section shows promise in its ability to effectively summarize the context. But the several grammatical errors impact its readability. 

The blueprint section does not include enough key information on U-Space, nor does it explain what U-Space is. 
E.g.:
”U-space is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for large numbers of drones. 

These services rely on a high level of digitalisation and automation of functions, whether they are on board the drone itself or part of the ground-based environment. 

U-space provides an enabling framework to support routine drone operations, as well as a clear and effective interface to manned aviation.”

This section is far too brief and lacks sufficient detail, especially considering the prime objective of the press release. Additionally, the written style here is disjointed, making it difficult to understand. A better, more detailed way to convey this information:
E.g.:

“The delivery of U-space relies upon the following key principles:
•	To ensure the safety of all airspace users operating in the U-space framework, as well as people on the ground.
•	To provide a scalable, flexible and adaptable system that can respond to changes in demand, volume, technology, business models and applications, while managing the interface with manned aviation.
•	To enable high-density operations with multiple automated drones under the supervision of fleet operators.
•	To guarantee equitable and fair access to airspace for all users.
•	To enable competitive and cost-effective service provision at all times, supporting the business models of drone operators.
•	To minimise deployment and operating costs by leveraging as much of the existing aeronautical services and infrastructure as possible, including GNSS as well as those from other sectors, such as mobile communication services.
•	To accelerate deployment by adopting technologies and standards from other sectors where they meet the needs of U-space.
•	To follow a risk-based and performance-driven approach when setting up appropriate requirements for safety, security and resilience, while minimising environmental impact and respecting the privacy of citizens, including data protection.”

The opportunities and threats section illustrates a pleasing and much stronger written style. Areas of opposition are highlighted effectively and there is evidence of solid reasoning.

Would have been useful to pinpoint data here from Gartner regarding the 3 million drones that are expected to be shipped and that should translate into revenues of $6 billion. 
Conversely, the section entitled Next Steps includes far too much detail that again impacts the coherence. The pertinent information should been summarized more succinctly. The written style should reflect that this is a press release and that the intended audience is the general public. For this reason, there should be an emphasis on ease of readability. 

E.g.:
“The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules that are proportionate to the risk of the operation. 
These rules will implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which the European Parliament and the Council (i.e. the EU Member States) are expected to adopt in the coming months.

The Commission, through the SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system.”

A conclusion should be included to summarize the main points of the press release.

As it stands, there’s a sense that the document has not quite been finished. 

The legal framework on AI, the background as well as the proposals to classify AI tools according to their perceived risk level from minimal through to limited, high and unacceptable could have been mentioned in a little more detail. 

A brief conclusion to round the speaking points off should also have been included.
E.g.:
“Allow me to conclude this brief presentation now.
Generative AI has the potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.
This poses a threat to our democratic society.

The author adequately manages the central theme revolving around the advantages and challenges of Generative Artificial Intelligence is apparent, although it could be strengthened with an explicit thesis statement.

The central message—that GAI has both benefits and associated risks—is communicated clearly.

Observations
The candidate clearly has a very high level of writing capability. The most relevant information has been summarized and convincing arguments with solid reasoning are employed. 

However, the style and tone is more suited to a written briefing than a speech.  

Although it is a speech, it is still advisable to clearly mark sections on the document for the speaker: e.g., introduction; what is generative AI; the dangers of generative AI; legal framework on AI; new rules for generative AI; conclusion.

Considering this is a press conference, consider an introduction that would better capture the attention of the audience in a couple of impactful, punchy sentences and quickly summarize what the speech will touch on. 

For example, could have alluded to ChatGPT and DALL.E, recognizable names that generative AI is known as in the public sphere. 

Again, considering this is a speech, include something that would immediately connect with the emotion of the audience. For example, people are fearful of losing their jobs in the not-to-distant future.

Use the introduction to also communicate the consequences this technology could have regarding the future of work, for society, politics and democracy. And that the goal is to stop disinformation by way of a clear labelling system. 

The body of the document is written clearly and fluently with a very pleasing style. 

Could have mentioned that generative AI produces text that appears authentic and human-like.

Regarding the legal framework: Perhaps mention what the obligations entail re tools that receive a high-risk classification. They will not be banned, but those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations. 

Some grammar issues – allow enough time to proof-read the work. 

Unfortunate that the candidate was unable to finish the speech in the time available.  A brief conclusion was omitted as a result. 

Although most key issues were covered, these points were not, most probably due to lack of time. 

-  a clear labelling system for services with potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation.
- services that integrate generative AI such as Bingchat for Microsoft and Bard for Google should include safeguards so that they cannot be used by malicious actors. 
- the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act.
- obligations on labelling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament and the Commission.

Although written in a pleasing style, the briefing document would have benefitted from a clearer structure. 
E.g., introduction & background/ main issues /options for the way forward & recommendations/ conclusion. 

The candidate has successfully identified the main areas of concern and offered some recommendations. But some of the information towards the end of the document would have worked better in the introduction/background section where it could have provided better context.

The issue with DG AGRI should have been flagged immediately and expanded upon.

The candidate has made an effort to explain the low, medium and high ambition options that the legislative proposal is based on, as well as the main issues involved. Perhaps these issues could have been listed in a clearer way. 
E.g.:
The legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: 
1.	restricting the use of cages/crates;
2.	ending the killing of day-old male chickens;
3.	banning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and
4.	setting animal welfare requirements at import.

Overall, the main issues section needs to be expanded to detail the support from other DGs, as well as the concern and viewpoints of DG AGRI and DG SANTE.

The candidate has done a good job in summarizing some key issues in relation to space requirement concerns and that farmers would need to be compensated. The risk of unfair competition from third countries is mentioned but not fully explored.

Would also have been useful to touch on the following points:

E.g.:
- Perhaps mention that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- Also, could expand by explaining that it is not the main issue for small farmers, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. 
- Additionally, that for several member states, the cage ban will make no difference as they have already adopted the ban with national legislation. The cage ban therefore helps create a more level playing field. 

In the recommendations section, there are some good suggestions made. But overall, there is a tendency to veer towards being too concise, to the detriment of the briefing. Fully expand on the reasoning behind taking different options.

Could have also included more concrete options for the way forward in reaching an agreement with DG AGRI. 

E.g.: Compromise on cage ban or compromise on import rules. Could more fully analyse the reasoning for each option and add suggestions that lead to a solution, such as accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages in exchange for increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).

Provide a conclusion that summarizes your recommendations as well as briefly explaining why this is the best course of action.

Observations
The central argument, which is the draft revised animal welfare regulation, is communicated clearly.

The central message—that the European Commission is proposing legislation to phase out animal cages to improve animal welfare—is quite effectively communicated.

The flow of the communication is logical, starting with an introduction, followed by the main argument and challenges, and concluding with the Commission’s goals.

The layout is clear but lacks visual elements that could make it more engaging.

The titles and subtitles are present, but they could be made more specific for better clarity.

The tone is formal and appropriate for a briefing note.

The language is mostly clear, but it could be more concise, especially in the ""Main argument"" section.

There is no noticeable bias in the communication.

The document has a clearly titled ""Introduction"" section.
There is no clearly titled ""Recommendations"" section.
The document includes a ""Conclusion"" section, but this could be expanded.

More content is needed to better explore the topic.

Supporting statistics are not present in the text, which would have greatly strengthened the argument.

The text specifically mentions the European Union but does not list individual EU member states.

Non-EU countries are not mentioned in the text.

Spelling Mistakes:
""and and"" in the Conclusion should be ""and""

Grammar Mistakes:
""On the long-run, the long-term sustainability"" could be corrected to ""In the long run, the sustainability""
Overall, the document is a well-structured and clear briefing note but could benefit from the inclusion of a ""Recommendations"" section, statistical evidence, and minor language refinements.

Observations

The central theme, which is the proposal for a new Regulation on animal welfare, is communicated relatively clearly, though it could benefit from a more straightforward presentation.

The central message, focusing on the need for animal welfare and the options to improve it, is discernible but could be presented more clearly.

The text mostly follows a logical flow but suffers from some inconsistencies, such as numbering and jumbled points in the ""ISSUE AND POSSIBLE OPTIONS"" section.

While the layout is relatively clear, it could be improved with consistent bullet points and perhaps the inclusion of sub-headers within sections.

Titles and subtitles are broadly adequate. 

The tone of the document is formal and suits the context of a briefing note.

The language is generally straightforward, but it could be simplified further to enhance accessibility.

There does not appear to be overt bias in the communication.

The document includes a clearly titled INTRODUCTION section, setting the stage for the main content.

There is a clearly titled RECOMMENDATION section, but it might benefit from a more structured presentation.

A clearly titled CONCLUSIONS section is missing from the document.

Observations

The candidate has identified the main areas of concern and has done a commendable job in structuring the information clearly.
 
I would have preferred to see a more detailed introduction and background section, as well as a section that dealt with the main issues. This could have immediately flagged the problem with DG AGRI and clearly listed the main issues that the legislative proposal includes.
E.g.,
The legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: 
1.	restricting the use of cages/crates;
2.	ending the killing of day-old male chickens;
3.	banning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and
4.	setting animal welfare requirements at import.

In the policy recommendations section, some more detailed information could have been useful. 

E.g., The timing for bans were subject to being based on low, medium or high ambition options for each measure, so perhaps briefly mentioning these would aid the reader in grasping the issue more fully. It would also enable you to refer to these later on when weighing which option could lead to DG AGRI’s positive response.

Although there is concrete data to back up the arguments against the recommended policies, there is a lack of hard numbers for the arguments in favour. This makes it difficult to convey why the policies should be followed. 
E.g.:
- Perhaps mention that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- Also, could expand by explaining that it is not the main issue for small farmers, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. 
- Additionally, that for several member states, the cage ban will make no difference as they have already adopted the ban with national legislation. The cage ban therefore helps create a more level playing field. 

Could have also included more concrete options for the way forward in reaching an agreement with DG AGRI.

E.g.: Compromise on cage ban or compromise on import rules. Could more fully analyse the reasoning for each option and add suggestions that lead to a solution, such as accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages in exchange for increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).

Overall, there is a tendency to veer towards being too concise, to the detriment of strengthening the arguments and proposals.

There are some grammatical issues that slightly impact the readability of the document.
","KEY OBSERVATIONS:
- The trainee's answer lacks clarity and conciseness. The sentences are overly complicated and unclear, making it difficult for the reader to understand the message.

- The trainee's arguments and reasoning are weak and not well-developed. They fail to convey the key points effectively.
- The trainee does not take into account the point of view of others, specifically DG AGRI, and does not address the concerns raised by them.
