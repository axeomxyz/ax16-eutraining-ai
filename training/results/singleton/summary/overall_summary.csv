","SUMMARY
The trainee's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the case study content and addresses the main issues related to the lithium supply chain. The trainee provides a clear background and highlights the potential challenges and opportunities for the European Union (EU) in building a resilient lithium supply chain. The trainee also suggests potential measures to address these challenges and proposes a simple agenda for the internal meeting.

Strengths:
1. Clear understanding of the case study content: The trainee accurately summarizes the key points from the case study content, including the goals of the European Green Deal, the potential challenges for the EU in securing a lithium supply chain, and the opportunities presented by the Inflation Reduction Act in the US and new technologies like direct lithium extraction.
2. Identification of main issues: The trainee correctly identifies the main issues related to the lithium supply chain, such as the increasing global demand for lithium, the EU's dependency on third countries for supply and refinement, and the potential impact of ECHA's classification of certain lithium salts as hazardous.
3. Proposed measures: The trainee suggests two potential measures to address the challenges faced by the EU in building a resilient lithium supply chain. These measures include aligning the attractiveness of the EU market with the incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act in the US and integrating the batteries regulation with a system that values production chains that comply with EU requirements for human health.
4. Clear and concise writing: The trainee's writing is clear and concise, making it easy to understand the main points and recommendations.

Weaknesses:
1. Lack of specific examples: The trainee's answer could be strengthened by providing specific examples or evidence to support the proposed measures and recommendations.

Summary
Unfortunately, this is an unsuccessful case study that contains the basis of a good one, but it needs more elaboration.
First and foremost,  while list format is more than welcome in some cases (e.g. pro/con lists), we expect a coherent, consistent, professional, and easy-flowing text. Make every connection and causation explicit, no matter how obvious they are; thus, you can enhance the cohesion of your text and achieve stronger content points. Merge short, one-sentence paragraphs to improve your case study's narrative arch.
Keep it as simple as you can: use sentence structure and length you are confident with, as some style issues can lessen the effect even of an impeccably discussed problem point. Typos and some grammar aspects (e.g., article use, verb agreement, verb forms) can be controlled with some attention even in an exam situation. They can heavily influence your score for the communication competence.
Keep track of all the information: take notes, for it's better to sort out or merge details while writing than leave out something.
If the source documents provide some insight into the given subject matter’s international aspects, then it is worth discussing it in a few sentences to provide a full picture.
It is helpful to frame your text with an introduction and conclusion; first, you can put the issue in context; second, you can enhance the professional feel of the study; and, finally, you can show that you finished the text as you intended and not because the time ran out.
It is always great to spend a few sentences on future options, possibilities, or even problems to give an even more professional impression.
