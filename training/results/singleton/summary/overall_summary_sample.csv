SUMMARY
Dear Trainee,

Thank you for your submission. I have reviewed your memo and provided feedback on various aspects of your writing. Please find the detailed feedback below.

KEY OBSERVATIONS
The writing style of the candidate is clear and concise. The clarity and tone of the text are appropriate for a memo. The structure of the text is well-organized with clear headings and subheadings. The key message of the text is to address the issues and challenges related to the lithium supply chain in Europe and propose solutions to overcome them. The logic and flow of the text are generally good, but there are some areas where the arguments could be further developed. The language of the text is generally clear and jargon-free, but there are some grammar and sentence structure errors that need to be addressed.

DETAILED FEEDBACK
1. Content: The content of your memo addresses the main issues related to the lithium supply chain in Europe and proposes solutions to overcome them. However, there are some areas where the arguments could be further developed and supported with more evidence or examples. For example, when discussing the potential ban on certain lithium salts by ECHA, you could provide more information on the potential impact of this ban on the lithium supply chain in Europe.

2. Grammar and mechanics: There are several grammar and sentence structure errors in your memo. For example, in the sentence ""The goals of the European green deal and other climate change policies have underlined the strategic role plaied by batteries on reaching the environmental objectives,"" the word ""plaied"" should be ""played."" Additionally, there are some missing articles and prepositions in your sentences, such as ""the context is changed"" should be ""the context has changed"" and ""the EU depends on supply and refinement of Lithium"" should be ""the EU depends on the supply and refinement of Lithium.""

3. Sentence structure: Some of your sentences are too long and complex, which can make it difficult for the reader to understand your message. Try to break down long sentences into shorter, more concise sentences to improve clarity and readability.

4. Clarity: Overall, your memo is easy to read and understand. However, there are some areas where the clarity could be improved. For example, in the sentence ""Therefore we must value the production made in the EU and grant an incentive for each major stage of the production process,"" it is not clear what you mean by ""value the production made in the EU."" Provide more specific details or examples to clarify your point.

5. Organization: The organization of your memo is generally good, with clear headings and subheadings. However, there are some areas where the organization could be improved. For example, in the section ""Way Forward,"" you discuss the need to align the attractiveness of the EU market to the US market, but it is not clear how this relates to the issues and challenges of the lithium supply chain in Europe. Make sure that each section of your memo is directly related to the main topic and supports your arguments and recommendations.

6. Style: The style of your memo is appropriate for a formal document like a memo. However, there are some areas where the language could be improved. For example, in the sentence ""Before our internal meeting, I will reach our colleagues in ECHA for an update on the potential ban for certain lithium salts,"" it would be better to say ""I will contact our colleagues in ECHA"" instead of ""reach."" Additionally, avoid using contractions like ""can't"" and ""won't"" in formal writing.

The strong points of your text were the following:
- Clear and concise writing style
- Well-organized structure with clear headings and subheadings
- Addressed the main issues and challenges related to the lithium supply chain in Europe

Where I suggest improvement is:
- Develop and support your arguments with more evidence and examples
- Check for grammar and sentence structure errors
- Break down long sentences into shorter, more concise sentences for clarity
- Provide more specific details and examples to clarify your points
- Ensure that each section of your memo is directly related to the main topic and supports your arguments and recommendations
- Use formal language and avoid contractions in formal writing

The quality, relevance, and conciseness of your arguments were generally good, but there is room for improvement in providing more evidence and examples to support your points.

Overall, your memo shows potential, but there are areas where you can further improve your writing skills. I suggest practicing writing memos and focusing on grammar and sentence structure to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your communication.

Keep up the good work and continue practicing to improve your writing skills!

Best regards,

Summary
Unfortunately, this is an unsuccessful case study that contains the basis of a good one, but it needs more elaboration.
First and foremost,  while list format is more than welcome in some cases (e.g. pro/con lists), we expect a coherent, consistent, professional, and easy-flowing text. Make every connection and causation explicit, no matter how obvious they are; thus, you can enhance the cohesion of your text and achieve stronger content points. Merge short, one-sentence paragraphs to improve your case study's narrative arch.
Keep it as simple as you can: use sentence structure and length you are confident with, as some style issues can lessen the effect even of an impeccably discussed problem point. Typos and some grammar aspects (e.g., article use, verb agreement, verb forms) can be controlled with some attention even in an exam situation. They can heavily influence your score for the communication competence.
Keep track of all the information: take notes, for it's better to sort out or merge details while writing than leave out something.
If the source documents provide some insight into the given subject matter’s international aspects, then it is worth discussing it in a few sentences to provide a full picture.
It is helpful to frame your text with an introduction and conclusion; first, you can put the issue in context; second, you can enhance the professional feel of the study; and, finally, you can show that you finished the text as you intended and not because the time ran out.
It is always great to spend a few sentences on future options, possibilities, or even problems to give an even more professional impression.

Summary

This is a good case study with some room for improvement in all competencies.
First and foremost, use sentence structure and length you are confident with, as some style issues can lessen the effect even of an impeccably discussed problem point. Typos and some grammar aspects (e.g., article use, verb agreement, verb forms) can be controlled with some attention even in an exam situation. They can heavily influence your score for the communication competence. 
While list format is more than welcome in some cases (e.g. pro/con lists), we expect a coherent, consistent, professional, and easy-flowing text. Make every connection and causation explicit, no matter how obvious they are; thus, you can enhance the cohesion of your text and achieve stronger content points. Merge short, one-sentence paragraphs to improve your case study's narrative arch. 
If the source documents provide some insight into whether the given subject matter has international aspects , then it is worth discussing in a short list or in one or two sentences such possibilities as well, in order to provide a full picture.
It is helpful to frame your text with an introduction and conclusion; first, you can put the issue in context; second, you can enhance the professional feel of the study; and, finally, you can show that you finished the text as you intended and not because the time ran out.
