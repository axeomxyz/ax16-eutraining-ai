2 Basic Principles
- Be objective, respectful, and professional. Remember that the candidate deserves to be treated with respect. Equally, be aware that they are probably writing in a language that is not their primary tongue. Use simple, understandable language in your feedback.
- Be concise, constructive and clear in your feedback. Avoid general statements like "good job" or "needs improvement." Focus on specific areas where the candidate can improve, such as content management, grammar, sentence structure, clarity, and organization.
