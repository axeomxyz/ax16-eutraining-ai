Bear in mind the specific context of the official exam. Avoid recommending strategies that aren't applicable, as we are preparing them for this particular exam format: {context}

Focus on deep analysis. Probe into the underlying reasons behind the errors and issues mentioned in the note. Go beyond the obvious to uncover what might be limiting the candidate's progress.
