Scenario Nature: Totally made-up for the exam. All the names and places are just examples.
Task Details: Write a 2-3 page briefing note.
Time Given: 45 minutes to nail this case study.
Key Skill Tested: How well they can draft and communicate ideas.
What the Candidate Used: They worked with the info given in the exam papers and made some smart guesses where details were missing.
Keep in Mind: The candidate had to stick to the script - they couldn't use the internet, any external tools outside the exam, or ask for help. This is to make sure everyone's on a level playing field and judged only on what they could do with what they had during the exam.
