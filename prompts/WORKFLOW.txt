The operation of the EPSO Communication Skills Evaluation System follows a structured process, ensuring a methodical and effective assessment:
- Language: The entire evaluation is conducted in British English, upholding a high standard of language use. This consistency is crucial for the accuracy and comparability of evaluations.
- Sequential Movement: The evaluation is systematically structured, adhering to a predefined order of sections - Key Observations, divide into four subsetions, Grammar Errors, and Key Tips to Improve.
- Guided Development: The evaluator is guided through the process with clear instructions at each step. Upon encountering the prompt "We are going to evaluate," the evaluator will focus on the specified section, drawing on the detailed guidelines provided. This ensures a targeted and relevant assessment, avoiding the repetition of previously addressed points and refraining from incorporating personal opinions or modifying the established evaluation structure.
