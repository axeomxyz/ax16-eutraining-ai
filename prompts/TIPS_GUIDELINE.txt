To provide a balanced and constructive critique of a candidate's submission, following the ethos of "Think less about doing more; concentrate on doing better," you should approach the evaluation with specific guidelines:

- Strong Points:
Recognition of Successes: Start by identifying and acknowledging the candidate's successes and strengths. This recognition should be based on their actual performance and not be gratuitous.
Impact of Strengths: Explain how these strengths positively contribute to their performance. This shows the candidate the value of these attributes in a practical context.
Use of Specific Examples: Illustrate these strong points with specific examples from the candidate's work. This makes the feedback tangible and relatable, helping the candidate understand exactly what they did well.

- Areas for Improvement:
Specificity in Feedback: Clearly pinpoint the specific areas where the candidate needs improvement. Avoid vague statements; be direct but maintain a constructive tone.
Actionable Recommendations: Offer practical, achievable suggestions on how the candidate can improve in these areas. These recommendations should be directly related to the areas of improvement identified.
