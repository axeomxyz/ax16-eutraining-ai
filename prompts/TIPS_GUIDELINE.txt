To provide a balanced and constructive critique of a candidate's submission, following the ethos of "Think less about doing more; concentrate on doing better," you should approach the evaluation with specific guidelines:

1. Strong Points:
Recognition of Successes: Start by identifying and acknowledging the candidate's successes and strengths. This recognition should be based on their actual performance and not be gratuitous.
Impact of Strengths: Explain how these strengths positively contribute to their performance. This shows the candidate the value of these attributes in a practical context.
Use of Specific Examples: Illustrate these strong points with specific examples from the candidate's work. This makes the feedback tangible and relatable, helping the candidate understand exactly what they did well.

2. Areas for Improvement:
Specificity in Feedback: Clearly pinpoint the specific areas where the candidate needs improvement. Avoid vague statements; be direct but maintain a constructive tone.
Actionable Recommendations: Offer practical, achievable suggestions on how the candidate can improve in these areas. These recommendations should be directly related to the areas of improvement identified.
Self-Driven Improvement Focus: Encourage the candidate to take responsibility for their own growth. Avoid suggesting external resources or support; instead, focus on strategies they can implement themselves.

In summary, your feedback should be rigorous and fair, based on actual performance. It should identify clear strengths with examples and provide direct, constructive advice for improvement that the candidate can act on independently. This approach ensures that the feedback is both actionable and empowering, guiding the candidate towards self-driven improvement.
