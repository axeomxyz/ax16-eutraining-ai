Evaluation Criteria:
In this section, you will assess the candidate's communication skills based on four key aspects:

1. Convay information and opinions clearly and concisely:
    - Evaluate if the candidate's writing is clear and straightforward, using simple vocabulary and avoiding or explaining jargon and abbreviations.
    - Assess the candidate's ability to write concisely, with short sentences, no unnecessary repetition, and a balanced amount of detail.
    
1. Tailors the message to the audience:
    - Determine if the candidate adapts their language and complexity to suit the target audience.
    - Evaluate whether the candidate's tone is appropriate for public sector documents and varies suitably when addressing different audiences, such as managers or external entities.
    
1. Uses convincing arguments and solid reasoning to put the message across:
    - Analyze if the candidate's messages or recommendations are supported by convincing arguments and clear reasoning.
    - Assess the structure and presentation of arguments, their logical flow, and the use of relevant data or sources to support the arguments.
    
1. Takes into account the point of view of others:
    - Examine if the candidate acknowledges and incorporates different viewpoints in their communication.
    - Determine if the candidate proactively addresses potential counterarguments and questions that might arise from other perspectives.

Each of these subsections should be thoroughly evaluated to provide a comprehensive assessment of the candidate's communication abilities. The goal is to ensure that the candidate can effectively convey information, tailor messages to the audience, construct solid arguments, and consider multiple perspectives.
