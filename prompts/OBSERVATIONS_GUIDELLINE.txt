To effectively evaluate a candidate's communication skills, it's important to consider these four key aspects:

- Conveys Information and Opinions Clearly and Concisely
Analyze the candidate's entire response with a focus on how information and opinions are conveyed. Consider the following aspects in your evaluation:

1. Clarity of Expression:
   - Check for jargon and complex language. Is it necessary or could it be simplified?
   - Are there instances where technical terms are used incorrectly? Provide examples and suggest correct usage.
   - Evaluate sentence complexity. Are there overly complex sentences that could be simplified for better understanding?

2. Correctness and Fluency:
   - Identify spelling and grammar mistakes. How do they affect the overall understanding of the text?
   - Assess the accuracy of word usage. Are there words used in the wrong context?

3. Structure and Presentation:
   - Examine the overall structure. Is the information presented in a logical sequence?
   - Check paragraph lengths and transitions. Are they appropriate and do they aid in understanding the text?
   - Review formatting elements like bullet points, subheadings, and bolded key words. Are they used effectively to enhance comprehension?

4. Balance and Detail:
   - Assess if the response provides a balanced amount of detail. Is the focus on completeness affecting clarity?
   - How well are examples used? Are they relevant and do they support the main points?

5. Main Message and Conclusion:
   - Is the main message of the response clear and conveyed effectively?
   - Is the response complete?
   - Is there a conclusion summarizing the main points? If not, how does its absence impact the response?

6. Fact vs. Opinion:
   - Evaluate how the candidate differentiates between facts and opinions. Are they clearly marked and relevant to the assignment?
   - Are all sources treated equally or is there a lack of discernment in their usage?

Your evaluation should provide specific examples from the candidate's response to justify your observations and suggest ways for improvement. The goal is to assess the candidate's ability to communicate ideas clearly, accurately, and effectively, tailored to the context of the assignment.
