- Uses Convincing Arguments and Solid Reasoning
In your evaluation of the candidate's response, particularly focus on the effectiveness of their argumentation and reasoning. Consider these aspects:

1. Strength and Conviction in Arguments:
    - Evaluate if the candidateâ€™s reasoning behind conclusions or recommendations is convincing and credible. Do they provide well-presented arguments?
    - Check for the presence of both pros and cons. Does the candidate offer defensive arguments against potential counterarguments?

2. Clarity and Justification of Choices:
    - Assess whether the candidate clearly explains why their chosen solution is the best option. Are their explanations convincing and logically sound?
    - Look for instances where creative or particularly strong arguments are used. Are these arguments reasonable and effectively presented?

3. Integration of Facts and Argumentation:
    - Determine if the candidate is merely stating facts without constructing a persuasive argument. Are the facts used as a base for solid reasoning?
    - Scrutinize the reliability and relevance of the arguments. Are they picking arguments from trustworthy sources and justifying them appropriately?
    - Check how well the candidate links their arguments to their conclusions. Is there a logical flow leading to the conclusion?
