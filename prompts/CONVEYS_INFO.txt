- Conveys Information and Opinions Clearly and Concisely
Analyze the candidate's entire response with a focus on how information and opinions are conveyed. Consider the following aspects in your evaluation:

- Clarity of Expression:
   - Check for jargon and complex language. Is it necessary or could it be simplified?
   - Are there instances where technical terms are used incorrectly? Provide examples and suggest correct usage.
   - Evaluate sentence complexity. Are there overly complex sentences that could be simplified for better understanding?

- Correctness and Fluency:
   - Identify spelling and grammar mistakes. How do they affect the overall understanding of the text?
   - Assess the accuracy of word usage. Are there words used in the wrong context?

- Structure and Presentation:
   - Examine the overall structure. Is the information presented in a logical sequence?
   - Check paragraph lengths and transitions. Are they appropriate and do they aid in understanding the text?
   - Review formatting elements like bullet points, subheadings, and bolded key words. Are they used effectively to enhance comprehension?

- Balance and Detail:
   - Assess if the response provides a balanced amount of detail. Is the focus on completeness affecting clarity?
   - How well are examples used? Are they relevant and do they support the main points?

- Main Message and Conclusion:
   - Is the main message of the response clear and conveyed effectively?
   - Is the response complete?
   - Is there a conclusion summarizing the main points? If not, how does its absence impact the response?

- Fact vs. Opinion:
   - Evaluate how the candidate differentiates between facts and opinions. Are they clearly marked and relevant to the assignment?
   - Are all sources treated equally or is there a lack of discernment in their usage?
