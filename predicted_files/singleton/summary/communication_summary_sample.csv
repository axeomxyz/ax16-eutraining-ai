SUMMARY
Dear Trainee,

Thank you for your submission. I have reviewed your memo and provided feedback on various aspects of your writing. Please find the detailed feedback below.

KEY OBSERVATIONS
The writing style of the candidate is clear and concise. The clarity and tone of the text are appropriate for a memo. The structure of the text is well-organized with clear headings and subheadings. The key message of the text is to address the issues and challenges related to the lithium supply chain in Europe and propose solutions to overcome them. The logic and flow of the text are generally good, but there are some areas where the arguments could be further developed. The language of the text is generally clear and jargon-free, but there are some grammar and sentence structure errors that need to be addressed.

DETAILED FEEDBACK
1. Content: The content of your memo addresses the main issues related to the lithium supply chain in Europe and proposes solutions to overcome them. However, there are some areas where the arguments could be further developed and supported with more evidence or examples. For example, when discussing the potential ban on certain lithium salts by ECHA, you could provide more information on the potential impact of this ban on the lithium supply chain in Europe.

2. Grammar and mechanics: There are several grammar and sentence structure errors in your memo. For example, in the sentence ""The goals of the European green deal and other climate change policies have underlined the strategic role plaied by batteries on reaching the environmental objectives,"" the word ""plaied"" should be ""played."" Additionally, there are some missing articles and prepositions in your sentences, such as ""the context is changed"" should be ""the context has changed"" and ""the EU depends on supply and refinement of Lithium"" should be ""the EU depends on the supply and refinement of Lithium.""

3. Sentence structure: Some of your sentences are too long and complex, which can make it difficult for the reader to understand your message. Try to break down long sentences into shorter, more concise sentences to improve clarity and readability.

4. Clarity: Overall, your memo is easy to read and understand. However, there are some areas where the clarity could be improved. For example, in the sentence ""Therefore we must value the production made in the EU and grant an incentive for each major stage of the production process,"" it is not clear what you mean by ""value the production made in the EU."" Provide more specific details or examples to clarify your point.

5. Organization: The organization of your memo is generally good, with clear headings and subheadings. However, there are some areas where the organization could be improved. For example, in the section ""Way Forward,"" you discuss the need to align the attractiveness of the EU market to the US market, but it is not clear how this relates to the issues and challenges of the lithium supply chain in Europe. Make sure that each section of your memo is directly related to the main topic and supports your arguments and recommendations.

6. Style: The style of your memo is appropriate for a formal document like a memo. However, there are some areas where the language could be improved. For example, in the sentence ""Before our internal meeting, I will reach our colleagues in ECHA for an update on the potential ban for certain lithium salts,"" it would be better to say ""I will contact our colleagues in ECHA"" instead of ""reach."" Additionally, avoid using contractions like ""can't"" and ""won't"" in formal writing.

- Break down long sentences into shorter, more concise sentences for clarity
- Provide more specific details and examples to clarify your points
- Ensure that each section of your memo is directly related to the main topic and supports your arguments and recommendations
- Use formal language and avoid contractions in formal writing

The quality, relevance, and conciseness of your arguments were generally good, but there is room for improvement in providing more evidence and examples to support your points.

5,"Communication Summary: 
Observations
The candidate starts off by providing the context to the regulation of batteries and waste batteries in the status section in a well-written and concise fashion. This section illustrates strong potential in presenting key issues with clarity and cohesion. 

However, some further background/overview of the legislative situation could have been added. 
E.g.:
“In December 20XX-2, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on batteries and waste batteries.”

Could have had more clarity in expressing the purpose of the memo. 
E.g.:
“The purpose of this memo is to launch the interservice consultation procedure for the new Regulation on Batteries and waste batteries. It is intended to structure the review of the original proposal, considering the observations of the Council and the European Parliament, and to further materialize the specific requirements by setting measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based targets and objectives.”

The further sections of the memo omit several key issues and data concerning the topic. 

It could also have been structured in a clearer and more coherent way. The information thus seems disjointed and impacts the flow and readability of the document. For a manager with limited understanding of this area, it would be difficult to gain a complete picture of the topic and the interconnectivity of the issues. 

The Agenda section is far too concise. It could still use subheadings and bullet points but also should expand on the key points. 
E.g.: 
1. General points
The new regulation should apply to all batteries including all waste portable batteries, electric vehicle batteries, industrial batteries, starting, lightning and ignition batteries, and batteries for light means of transport (e.g., electric bikes, e-mopeds, e-scooters).
2. Supply chain of raw materials
3. Production of batteries in the EU
4. Functioning of the internal market

Overall, the memo leaves the impression of being a work-in-progress. 

Additionally, the topic of batteries is not related to the Green Deal and possible consequences.

Observations
The document is structured very well into clear sections where relevant information can be found.

The first section shows promise in its ability to effectively summarize the context. But the several grammatical errors impact its readability. 

The blueprint section does not include enough key information on U-Space, nor does it explain what U-Space is. 
E.g.:
”U-space is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for large numbers of drones. 

These services rely on a high level of digitalisation and automation of functions, whether they are on board the drone itself or part of the ground-based environment. 

U-space provides an enabling framework to support routine drone operations, as well as a clear and effective interface to manned aviation.”

This section is far too brief and lacks sufficient detail, especially considering the prime objective of the press release. Additionally, the written style here is disjointed, making it difficult to understand. A better, more detailed way to convey this information:
E.g.:

“The delivery of U-space relies upon the following key principles:
•	To ensure the safety of all airspace users operating in the U-space framework, as well as people on the ground.
•	To provide a scalable, flexible and adaptable system that can respond to changes in demand, volume, technology, business models and applications, while managing the interface with manned aviation.
•	To enable high-density operations with multiple automated drones under the supervision of fleet operators.
•	To guarantee equitable and fair access to airspace for all users.
•	To enable competitive and cost-effective service provision at all times, supporting the business models of drone operators.
•	To minimise deployment and operating costs by leveraging as much of the existing aeronautical services and infrastructure as possible, including GNSS as well as those from other sectors, such as mobile communication services.
•	To accelerate deployment by adopting technologies and standards from other sectors where they meet the needs of U-space.
•	To follow a risk-based and performance-driven approach when setting up appropriate requirements for safety, security and resilience, while minimising environmental impact and respecting the privacy of citizens, including data protection.”

The opportunities and threats section illustrates a pleasing and much stronger written style. Areas of opposition are highlighted effectively and there is evidence of solid reasoning.

Would have been useful to pinpoint data here from Gartner regarding the 3 million drones that are expected to be shipped and that should translate into revenues of $6 billion. 
Conversely, the section entitled Next Steps includes far too much detail that again impacts the coherence. The pertinent information should been summarized more succinctly. The written style should reflect that this is a press release and that the intended audience is the general public. For this reason, there should be an emphasis on ease of readability. 

E.g.:
“The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules that are proportionate to the risk of the operation. 
These rules will implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which the European Parliament and the Council (i.e. the EU Member States) are expected to adopt in the coming months.

The Commission, through the SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system.”

A conclusion should be included to summarize the main points of the press release.

A lot of potential is shown here in being able to focus on the relevant information and structure it clearly. 
But the writing style is more suited to a written briefing than a speech. Furthermore, the writing style could overall be elevated in fluency and tone. There are also several grammar and spelling mistakes throughout the document. 
Would benefit from having an introduction and conclusion.
Considering this is a briefing for a press conference, an introduction should be included that better captures the attention of the audience in a couple of impactful, punchy sentences and that quickly summarizes what the speech will touch on. 
E.g. Alluding to the introduction of ChatGPT and DALL.E: these are recognizable names that generative AI is known as in the public sphere. 
Something general should be included in the introduction about the consequences regarding the future of work, for society, politics and democracy. And that the goal is to stop disinformation by way of a clear labelling system.
Overall, the clarity of the message is at times diluted by too much detail of issues that are not strictly relevant e.g., mentioning the impact on the workforce is not the main issue of this particular briefing. At other times clarity suffers due to not having enough detail. 
More practice is needed in creating succinct yet clear arguments with just the right level of detail depending on the given task.
A brief conclusion should have also been included.

Observations
The candidate clearly has a very high level of writing capability. The most relevant information has been summarized and convincing arguments with solid reasoning are employed. 

However, the style and tone is more suited to a written briefing than a speech.  

Although it is a speech, it is still advisable to clearly mark sections on the document for the speaker: e.g., introduction; what is generative AI; the dangers of generative AI; legal framework on AI; new rules for generative AI; conclusion.

Considering this is a press conference, consider an introduction that would better capture the attention of the audience in a couple of impactful, punchy sentences and quickly summarize what the speech will touch on. 

For example, could have alluded to ChatGPT and DALL.E, recognizable names that generative AI is known as in the public sphere. 

Again, considering this is a speech, include something that would immediately connect with the emotion of the audience. For example, people are fearful of losing their jobs in the not-to-distant future.

Use the introduction to also communicate the consequences this technology could have regarding the future of work, for society, politics and democracy. And that the goal is to stop disinformation by way of a clear labelling system. 

The body of the document is written clearly and fluently with a very pleasing style. 

Could have mentioned that generative AI produces text that appears authentic and human-like.

Regarding the legal framework: Perhaps mention what the obligations entail re tools that receive a high-risk classification. They will not be banned, but those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations. 

Some grammar issues – allow enough time to proof-read the work. 

Unfortunate that the candidate was unable to finish the speech in the time available.  A brief conclusion was omitted as a result. 

Although most key issues were covered, these points were not, most probably due to lack of time. 

-  a clear labelling system for services with potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation.
- services that integrate generative AI such as Bingchat for Microsoft and Bard for Google should include safeguards so that they cannot be used by malicious actors.

Observations
Generally, this is a very good attempt to present a complex issue.
The introductory paragraph conveys relevant background information regarding the topic. However, the written style needs work in terms of professional fluency, and there are grammar issues that need to be ironed out. 

Also, I’m not entirely clear on the focus of the briefing from this introduction, as the disagreement of DG AGRI should be flagged from the outset. 

In the policy objective section, the key issues are set out clearly in bullet points.  However, from I. Main Issues, the briefing gives the impression of being a work-in-progress, due to its overreliance on writing in note form. Because of this, the text seems slightly disjointed and there is a lack of coherence at times. 
Furthermore, some points are not elaborated on further, analysed for their significance, or more completely argued. 
Some key details and relevant information is omitted or generalized. Providing more specifics and data on key issues will give a more comprehensive overview of the situation and lead to more informed reasoning regarding the solutions going forward. 
E.g.:
-  Could have mentioned that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- The timing for bans were subject to being based on low, medium or high ambition options for each measure, so briefly mention what these options mean.

The suggestions given are commendable, but these need to be clearer, with recommendations given with solid reasoning as well as an exploration of consequences.

Some further grammar issues and several typos impact the readability of the document.

Observations
Although written in a pleasing style, the briefing document would have benefitted from a clearer structure. 
E.g., introduction & background/ main issues /options for the way forward & recommendations/ conclusion. 

The candidate has successfully identified the main areas of concern and offered some recommendations. But some of the information towards the end of the document would have worked better in the introduction/background section where it could have provided better context.

The issue with DG AGRI should have been flagged immediately and expanded upon.

The candidate has made an effort to explain the low, medium and high ambition options that the legislative proposal is based on, as well as the main issues involved. Perhaps these issues could have been listed in a clearer way. 
E.g.:
The legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: 
1.	restricting the use of cages/crates;
2.	ending the killing of day-old male chickens;
3.	banning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and
4.	setting animal welfare requirements at import.

Overall, the main issues section needs to be expanded to detail the support from other DGs, as well as the concern and viewpoints of DG AGRI and DG SANTE.

The candidate has done a good job in summarizing some key issues in relation to space requirement concerns and that farmers would need to be compensated. The risk of unfair competition from third countries is mentioned but not fully explored.

Would also have been useful to touch on the following points:

E.g.:
- Perhaps mention that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- Also, could expand by explaining that it is not the main issue for small farmers, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. 
- Additionally, that for several member states, the cage ban will make no difference as they have already adopted the ban with national legislation. The cage ban therefore helps create a more level playing field. 

In the recommendations section, there are some good suggestions made. But overall, there is a tendency to veer towards being too concise, to the detriment of the briefing. Fully expand on the reasoning behind taking different options.

Could have also included more concrete options for the way forward in reaching an agreement with DG AGRI. 

E.g.: Compromise on cage ban or compromise on import rules. Could more fully analyse the reasoning for each option and add suggestions that lead to a solution, such as accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages in exchange for increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).

Provide a conclusion that summarizes your recommendations as well as briefly explaining why this is the best course of action. 

Provide a fall-back option if there is one available.

The candidate has identified the main areas of concern and has done a commendable job in structuring the information clearly.
 
I would have preferred to see a more detailed introduction and background section, as well as a section that dealt with the main issues. This could have immediately flagged the problem with DG AGRI and clearly listed the main issues that the legislative proposal includes.

2.	ending the killing of day-old male chickens;
3.	banning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and

E.g., The timing for bans were subject to being based on low, medium or high ambition options for each measure, so perhaps briefly mentioning these would aid the reader in grasping the issue more fully. It would also enable you to refer to these later on when weighing which option could lead to DG AGRI’s positive response.

Although there is concrete data to back up the arguments against the recommended policies, there is a lack of hard numbers for the arguments in favour. This makes it difficult to convey why the policies should be followed. 
E.g.:
- Perhaps mention that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- Also, could expand by explaining that it is not the main issue for small farmers, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms.
