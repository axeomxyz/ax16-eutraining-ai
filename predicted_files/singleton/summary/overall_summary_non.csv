Unfortunately, this is an unsuccessful case study that contains the basis of a good one, but it needs more elaboration.
First and foremost,  while list format is more than welcome in some cases (e.g. pro/con lists), we expect a coherent, consistent, professional, and easy-flowing text. Make every connection and causation explicit, no matter how obvious they are; thus, you can enhance the cohesion of your text and achieve stronger content points. Merge short, one-sentence paragraphs to improve your case study's narrative arch.
Keep it as simple as you can: use sentence structure and length you are confident with, as some style issues can lessen the effect even of an impeccably discussed problem point. Typos and some grammar aspects (e.g., article use, verb agreement, verb forms) can be controlled with some attention even in an exam situation. They can heavily influence your score for the communication competence.
Keep track of all the information: take notes, for it's better to sort out or merge details while writing than leave out something.
If the source documents provide some insight into the given subject matterâ€™s international aspects, then it is worth discussing it in a few sentences to provide a full picture.
It is helpful to frame your text with an introduction and conclusion; first, you can put the issue in context; second, you can enhance the professional feel of the study; and, finally, you can show that you finished the text as you intended and not because the time ran out.
It is always great to spend a few sentences on future options, possibilities, or even problems to give an even more professional impression.

Summary
This is a good case that could have achieved an even higher score had there been more attention paid to the linguistic quality.
Some style issues can lessen the effect even of an impeccably discussed problem point. Typos and some grammar aspects (e.g., article use, verb agreement, verb forms) can be controlled with some attention even in an exam situation. They can heavily influence your score for the communication competence.
If you have to list the pros/cons of an issue, you should use similar format for both aspects while compiling relatively the same number of arguments - even if you are asked to take sides in the brief, the majority of the text should read impartial.
It is helpful to frame your text with an introduction and conclusion; first, you can put the issue in context; second, you can enhance the professional feel of the study; and, finally, you can show that you finished the text as you intended and not because the time ran out.

","According to the Notice of Competitions of current EPSO competitions, the only competency that will be assessed in the Case Study exam is Written Communication. Therefore, only this competency was assessed in your evaluation.

Summary:
Your briefing note provides an overview of the main issues and presents arguments and facts to help the Director-General make a decision on the ""End the cage age"" file. You have addressed the public demand, the impact assessment, stakeholder consultations, and the inter-service consultation. However, there are areas where improvement is needed to enhance the clarity, organization, and style of your writing.

The strong points of your text were the following:
- You provided a clear summary of the main issues and the purpose of the briefing note.
- You included relevant arguments and facts to support your recommendations.
- You mentioned the need for a balanced approach that considers the interests of farmers and the welfare of animals.

Where I suggest improvement is:
1. Content: While you addressed the main issues, it would have been beneficial to provide more specific information on the negative opinion of DG AGRI and the positive opinions of DG ENV and DG TRADE. Including specific comments or concerns from these departments would have added depth to your analysis.
2. Clarity: Some of your sentences are unclear or lack clarity. For example, in the section on the main issues, the sentence ""The current legislation is outdated, fragmented and too general"" could be rephrased to provide more specific information on the shortcomings of the current legislation.
3. Organization: Your briefing note would benefit from a clearer structure. Consider using headings and subheadings to separate different sections and make it easier for the reader to follow your arguments.
4. Style: Your writing style is generally clear, but there are some areas where it could be improved. Avoid using unnecessary abbreviations and ensure that your sentences are concise and jargon-free. Additionally, be mindful of the tone of your writing and ensure that it is appropriate for the audience.

The quality, relevance, and conciseness of your arguments were generally good. However, providing more specific information and addressing the opinions of DG AGRI, DG ENV, and DG TRADE would have strengthened your arguments. Additionally, ensuring clarity and organization in your writing would have made your arguments more effective.

Overall, your briefing note provides a good foundation, but there is room for improvement in terms of clarity, organization, and style. I suggest reviewing and revising your text to address these areas and enhance the overall quality of your writing.

Personalized tips for practice or improvement:
- Practice writing in a clear and concise manner, avoiding unnecessary abbreviations and jargon.
- Work on organizing your writing with headings and subheadings to improve the structure and flow of your arguments.

Summary

This is a good case study with some room for improvement in all competencies.
First and foremost, use sentence structure and length you are confident with, as some style issues can lessen the effect even of an impeccably discussed problem point. Typos and some grammar aspects (e.g., article use, verb agreement, verb forms) can be controlled with some attention even in an exam situation. They can heavily influence your score for the communication competence. 
While list format is more than welcome in some cases (e.g. pro/con lists), we expect a coherent, consistent, professional, and easy-flowing text. Make every connection and causation explicit, no matter how obvious they are; thus, you can enhance the cohesion of your text and achieve stronger content points. Merge short, one-sentence paragraphs to improve your case study's narrative arch. 
If the source documents provide some insight into whether the given subject matter has international aspects , then it is worth discussing in a short list or in one or two sentences such possibilities as well, in order to provide a full picture.
It is helpful to frame your text with an introduction and conclusion; first, you can put the issue in context; second, you can enhance the professional feel of the study; and, finally, you can show that you finished the text as you intended and not because the time ran out.

SUMMARY
The trainee's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the potentials and challenges of driverless cars. The content is well-researched and covers the benefits, challenges, levels of automation, regulatory frameworks, and ongoing work in the EU. The trainee effectively presents arguments and reasoning to support their points. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of grammar, sentence structure, clarity, and organization.

The strong points of your text were the following:
- The trainee provides a clear introduction and background information on driverless cars.

Where I suggest improvement is:
- Grammar and mechanics: There are several grammatical errors throughout the text, such as missing articles, incorrect verb forms, and inconsistent verb tenses. It is important to proofread the text carefully to correct these errors.
- Sentence structure: Some sentences are too long and complex, making it difficult to follow the trainee's arguments. It is important to break down complex ideas into shorter, more concise sentences for clarity.
- Clarity: Some ideas could be further clarified to ensure the reader fully understands the trainee's points. It is important to provide clear explanations and examples to support arguments.
- Organization: The trainee's answer lacks clear section headings and subheadings, making it difficult to navigate through the text. It is important to use headings and subheadings to clearly structure the content and guide the reader.
- Style: The trainee's writing style is generally appropriate for the audience, but there are some instances of jargon that could be defined or avoided. It is important to use clear and concise language that is accessible to a wide range of readers.

The quality, relevance, and conciseness of your arguments were generally good. However, there is room for improvement in terms of grammar, sentence structure, clarity, organization, and style.

Overall, the trainee's answer provides a solid understanding of the topic and effectively presents arguments and reasoning. With some improvements in grammar, sentence structure, clarity, organization, and style, the trainee's answer could be even stronger.

Some personalized tips for practice or improvement:
- Practice proofreading your writing to identify and correct grammatical errors.

- Use clear explanations and examples to support your arguments and ensure the reader fully understands your points.
