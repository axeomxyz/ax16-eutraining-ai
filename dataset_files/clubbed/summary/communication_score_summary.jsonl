An internal reflection and brainstorming meeting will be organized to fine-tune the original proposal in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to build a resilient lithium supply chain\n\nSummary: Europe is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for lithium, a key metal used in batteries for electric vehicles. The European Union (EU) plans to release its Critical Raw Materials Act, which will identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk. The EU aims to become climate neutral by 2050 and has set ambitious goals for the electrification of transportation. However, challenges faced by carmakers and concerns about supply availability and access to raw materials continue to impact the growth of the electric vehicle market in Europe.\n\nHeadline: European Commission considers classifying lithium as toxic\n\nSummary: The European Commission is considering a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If approved, this classification could undermine the EU's efforts to create a domestic battery materials supply chain. The EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium for its electric vehicle production sector, and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions. The proposal could have an impact on lithium mining, processing, cathode production, and recycling.\n\nHeadline: The Inflation Reduction Act stimulates battery mineral mining in the US\n\nSummary: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US is expected to stimulate a \"gold rush\" in battery mineral mining, refining, and production. The IRA offers tax credits for various stages of battery production and the battery supply chain, making it more appealing for companies to bring full-cycle battery production to the US. This includes mining and refining battery minerals, producing battery cells, and battery pack production. The IRA aims to reduce the US's dependence on China for battery minerals and increase domestic production.\n\nHeadline: Russia plans to start lithium mining in the next few years\n\nSummary: Russia is planning to start lithium mining based on ore deposits in the Murmansk region within the next three to four years. The country has significant lithium reserves, accounting for 10% of the world's reserves. The demand for lithium is expected to increase globally, and Russia aims to become one of the top five producers of lithium in the next eight years. The country is also exploring technologies for lithium production from solutions found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields.\n\nHeadline: Meeting the growing demand for lithium in the electric vehicle industry\n\nSummary: The demand for lithium is expected to rise significantly due to the growing electric vehicle industry. While there are concerns about whether there will be enough lithium to meet this demand, new technologies and sources of supply, such as direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP), can help fill the gap. These technologies offer the promise of increasing supply, reducing the industry's environmental footprint, and lowering costs. Battery recycling is also expected to increase, providing a secondary supply of lithium.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n01/03/20XX\nDear Ferdinand\nI am back to you with the memo as you have requested. If you have any comment I can modify the memo still today. \nBACKGROUND\nThe goals of the European green deal and other climate change policies have underlined the strategic role plaied by batteries on reaching the environmental objectives. In fact, the batteries are necessary to boost the production of energy from renewable sources. \nThe political agreement at EU level on the battery regulation is an important step. However, lithium, a key batteries material which is at the core of the batteries production cycle, is interested by a series of issues. These issues may compromise the goal of the proposal which aims at safe, sustainble and competitive batteries.\nIn fact, from the adoption of the regulation by the Commission, the context is changed. Outside the EU, the US may become extremely attractive to establish lithium production cycles on their territory by means of the IRA. Within the EU, the possible upcoming decision of the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) about the risk for human health because of certain key lithium salts, may compromise our internal investments on lithium supply and refining. \nMAIN ISSUES\nLithium is a key component of batteries. The global lithium demand will increase enormously in the next decade, and the global offer of lithium might not keep up the speed of the demand. This situation might be particularly critical in the EU where the lithium demand will be higher than in the rest of the world and the lithium mining and production is nonexistent. \nNowadays, the EU depends on supply and refinement of Lithium from third countries. Opening lithium mines and establishing lithium refinement plants in Europe, as foreseen in the proposal, will reduce the dependency from the third countries.\nHowever, if ECHA will decide to classify some key lithium salts hazardous for human health, its is expected that there will be an increase in the costs for mining and producing lithium in Europe, with potential exodus of investors.\nIn addition, on the other side of the Athlantic, the IRA makes extremely attractive to base lithium mining and refinement in the US terriotry.\nWAY FORWARD\nIt is necessary to impement new measures in the batteries regulation to prevent troubles for the european market and update the regulation to the new context.\nFirstly, regarding the production chain of batteries, we need to align the attractiveness of the EU market to those determined in the US by means of the IRA. Therefore we must value the production made in the EU and grant an incentive for each major stage of the production process. \nSecondly, independently from the ECHA decision, we cannot exclude that in future additional risks for human health will arise in the batteries product chain. Therefore we need to integrate the batteries regulation with a system that values the production chains that respect the EU law in terms of protection of the human health and on the other hand hinders those production chains that do not comply with the requirements for human health established by the EU. \nIn the long run, we will be able also to count on lithium recycling and on the use of new technologies like Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) and Direct Lithium to production (DLP), and the use of materials alternative to lithium can be explored. However, we need to invest on EU reserach to make these paths much more concrete.\nBefore our internal meeting, I will reach our collegues in ECHA for an update on the potential ban for certain lithium salts (the decision was expected by the beginning of this year). In case the ECHA will ban key lithiums salts, a revision of the impact assessment for the batteries regulation is desirable, the feasibility of this has to be checked during the internal meeting.\nAGENDA\nI've kept the agenda very simple and focused on our main issues for the ISC consultations: \n1 - Opening;\n2 - The proposal in the new context;\n3 - Fine-tuning the proposal:\n- the new global context  and attractiveness of the EU market;\n- valuing protection of human health in the batteries production chain;\n4 - Next steps for the fine-tuning of the proposal;\n5 - Closing of the meeting.\nI am available to support you on introducing points 3 ad 4 in partiular.  \nLooking forward\nYOU\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score(out-off 10): 7.0\n\nCommunication Summary: \nWhile the layout of the text is logical, it could benefit from subheadings to delineate sections more clearly.\n\nThe information is mostly communicated effectively, although some paragraphs are a bit dense.

These technologies offer the promise of increasing supply, reducing the industry's environmental footprint, and lowering costs. Battery recycling is also expected to increase, providing a secondary supply of lithium.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nIn the light of the upcoming surge of the demand of electric vehicles (EV), an even greater increase is expected in the industry of EV batteries and especially in the demand of lithium, which is a key chemical component of them. Demand is expected to increase by 500% until 2030, affecting its price accordingly, forcing EU to be dependable on imports due to the fact that no lithium processing or refining takes place within its territory.\nEU's intention to fully detach from Chinese-owned supply across all stages of the lithium-ion supply chain may prove impossible but it is expected to improve in the next decades. Thus, directly prohibiting supplies from Chinese-owned companies is not advisable due to the fact that China has a multi-year advantage over the rest of the world in terms of investment, know-how, processing equipment and resources.\nYet, it is imperative that the EU should take measures in order to remain competitive in the approximate future. Considering that the other main players, such us the USA, Russia and Canada have already started implementing policies aiming to decrease their dependancy for EV battery components from China or boost their own industries, EU has to take action. Specifically, the EU could examine strategies such as:\n- Subsidise companies in the industry of lithium extraction and processing that could possibly use new technologies (more efficient or enviroment friendly) to extract the mineral. Technologies such as DLE and DLP may prove a good investment in order for the EU to match the demand of lithium in the near future.\n- Incentivise companies that are already active in similar industries to invest in lithium extraction and processing as well or to examine whether some of their byproducts can be refined to be used as EV battery components.\n- Offer tax credits for companies in the lithium industry, as a countermeasure to the US IRA.\n- Negotiatie long term trade agreements with main producers such as Australia, Chile or Argentina as an attempt to control prices of imported lithium and thus retain a competitve advantage for its companies.\n Additionally, and in order to avoid a gradual exit of big EV manufacturers from EU, classifying lithium derivatives as dangerous will complicate the import procedure, production and handling of the materials, further increasing costs. In order to deal with the ECHA proposal concerning the toxicity of certain lithium salts, the EU could incentivise companies to adopt controls that will ensure that said chemicals are not hazardous for the public health.\n In conclusion, the sharply increasing trend in demand and consequently in prices of EV battery components will force the EU to implement specific measures in order to remain competitive. It has to regulate lithium imports in order to control the price, decrease dependancy from China and boost its own industry since EVs are a crucial factor when it comes to the transition to a greener economy.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score(out-off 10): 7.0\n\nCommunication Summary: \nThe layout of the text is mostly logical but could be more clear.

The legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of batteries, from raw material supply chain to production, reuse, and recycling. The proposal aligns with the European Green Deal, Circular Economy Action Plan, and New Industrial Strategy. The Council and European Parliament have reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. An internal reflection and brainstorming meeting will be organized to fine-tune the original proposal in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to build a resilient lithium supply chain\n\nSummary: Europe is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for lithium, a key metal used in batteries for electric vehicles. The European Union (EU) plans to release its Critical Raw Materials Act, which will identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk. The EU aims to become climate neutral by 2050 and has set ambitious goals for the electrification of transportation. However, challenges faced by carmakers and concerns about supply availability and access to raw materials continue to impact the growth of the electric vehicle market in Europe.\n\nHeadline: European Commission considers classifying lithium as toxic\n\nSummary: The European Commission is considering a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If approved, this classification could undermine the EU's efforts to create a domestic battery materials supply chain. The EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium for its electric vehicle production sector, and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions. The proposal could have an impact on lithium mining, processing, cathode production, and recycling.\n\nHeadline: The Inflation Reduction Act stimulates battery mineral mining in the US\n\nSummary: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US is expected to stimulate a \"gold rush\" in battery mineral mining, refining, and production. The IRA offers tax credits for various stages of battery production and the battery supply chain, making it more appealing for companies to bring full-cycle battery production to the US. This includes mining and refining battery minerals, producing battery cells, and battery pack production. The IRA aims to reduce the US's dependence on China for battery minerals and increase domestic production.\n\nHeadline: Russia plans to start lithium mining in the next few years\n\nSummary: Russia is planning to start lithium mining based on ore deposits in the Murmansk region within the next three to four years. The country has significant lithium reserves, accounting for 10% of the world's reserves. The demand for lithium is expected to increase globally, and Russia aims to become one of the top five producers of lithium in the next eight years. The country is also exploring technologies for lithium production from solutions found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields.\n\nHeadline: Meeting the growing demand for lithium in the electric vehicle industry\n\nSummary: The demand for lithium is expected to rise significantly due to the growing electric vehicle industry. While there are concerns about whether there will be enough lithium to meet this demand, new technologies and sources of supply, such as direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP), can help fill the gap. These technologies offer the promise of increasing supply, reducing the industry's environmental footprint, and lowering costs. Battery recycling is also expected to increase, providing a secondary supply of lithium.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nFor: Ferdinand Porsche (HoU DG MOVE)\n01/03/2023\nINTERNAL MEETING MEMO on sustainable, circular, European battery supply chain\nFACTS\nEU legislation is to ban combustion engine cars by 2035, plan with net-zero economy, climate neutral by 2050.\nImpossible to detach fuly from Chinese lithium-ion supply, but as the lithium processing companies are mostly EU-based dependency on China will improve. Lithium refining done mostly in China, cathodes produced there as well, mineral concentrate in Australia. China has years of advancement of supply chain and know how in the field.\nOutlook on less China dependency is thus more long term and legislation against China is therefore not likely to not hamper EU market development. EU has real potential to become self sufficient as regards raw materials via recycling in addtion to domestic supply.\nHowever, last year EU Commisions was considering ESHA proposal to classify lithium as toxic - bad news for EU mining, specifically for lithium mining, processing, cathode production and recycling.\nThis brings problems in factries in Portugal and Germany, and also in Serbia.\nImportant development in the US in connection with Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which has incentivised the whole battery cycle through tax credits. The attractiveness of this package is in stacking of bonuses (credits) on all steps of production of batteries, from refining to putting together of battery packs; and 50% pricing control on raw materials, all of which produces long term incentives.This creates attractiveness for companies to move business to the US, to have the whole process done in the US as the bonuses are linked to purely US based manufacture and assembly.\nRussia has 10% of raw materials, so the EU could consider this source.\nDirect lithium extraction (DLE) and DL product could provide for 10% of demannd of lithium supply by 2030, recycling of batteries could provide for 6% by the same date. Batteries will represent 95% of total demand of lithium by 2030.\n \nAGENDA FOR INTERNAL MEETING\nPROPOSALS/RECOMMENDATIONS in line with political priorities\n1) Strong support of lithium mining from geothermal sources due to lack of health hazard\n2) Legislation aimed at gradual cessation of supply of lithium-ion from Asia whilst increasing EU based supply via recycling and non-hazardous sources.\n3) Introduction of incentivisation of producers similar to US, for example 10 Eur per kwh, 10 Eur per cell assembly etc,, to attract companies and create strong base in long term.\n4) Increase supply from Chile, Argentina, Australia in shot and medium term.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score(out-off 10): 3.0\n\nCommunication Summary: \nObservations\nWith this competence, we basically evaluate the style of the case study.

INTRODUCCTION\nThe european union has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.In fact, recently EU proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035. \nIn 202x-2 electric car registrations for the year were 1.729.000, 60% up from 2020. \nThe administrtion in Brussels has been making ist environmetal and climate rules stricter for decades. the EU wants to make the entire continent carbon neutral by mid century. At the same time, it is etriving to achieve the highest level of protection from pollution in the world. Favourishing electric cars industry is an important point to manage its targets.\n \n2. POINTS IN\nDespite expectations that litium demand will rise from aproximately 500.000 metric tons of tithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2021, to some 3 or 4 million metric tons in 2030, it is expected that the lithium industry will be able to porvide enough product to supply the burgeoning tithioum-ion battery industry. \nIt is important to remark that the possibility of extending Electric vehicle battery life through use in the energy storage sector. Also it is important pay attention that battery recicling is expected to increase during the current decade. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in the end-life batteries.\n \n3. POINTS OUT\nThe energy transition and the decarbonization of industrial activity and power plants imply massive deployment of renovables, mostly solar and wind farms. However, as they depend on unstable weather conditions, the electric power system requires energy storage, in which the EU counts a lot on batteries.\nThe EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium to supply its electric vehicle production sector and the classification of lithium as toxic may increase its reliance on other regions, at a time when the Union is focused on energy security and reducing emissions.\nThe Eu has  added lithium to a list of critical raw materials as demand is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years. Adding lithium salts to the list of materials hazardous for the health may propt re revision of a range of projets in the industry.\nOthe point to study is that lithium reclycling is stills small scale although it it could reach 6 percent of announced supply by 2030.\n \n4. PROPOSALS\nIt is fundamental, to emphasize the economic key point. \nOffering cash money (tax credits) all the steps in the lithium electric car batteries production, for mining battery minerals, refining them, putting together battery cells and for putting together battery packs (or modules), could be essential to reduce the dependence of Asia and America.\nWorking on the investigation to increase recycling industry related to lithium form used electric car batterys must be actively favourised thought founding mechanismes.\n \n5. PRIORITIES OF THE CO-LEGISTATORS\nThe European Union is working in a very complicated environment. Not only war in Ucrania has obliged to review the economic expectations, but also the increasing prices of imported materials from China, important inputs for european indlustry.\nIt is important that Co-legislators create new founding squemes to favourise the electric car industry and also the reclycling industry favourising the study of reclycliong process of lithium batteries. It will be a hard work for Science, Environtment and industry Ministrys, which have to work in a same direction, becoming climate neutral by 2050.\n \n6. CONCLUSION\nThere is a lot of work to do but our indicators show that the EU runs in a good way. Our DG needs to work listening the needs of european citizens and Move industries, proposing founds and financial help conditions, managing the industrial deveolepment and the resilience.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score(out-off 10): 3.0\n\nCommunication Summary: \nObservations\nWith this competence, we basically evaluate the style of the case study.

U-space services will be offered to both private and public users of drones for various missions.\n\nHeadline: European Aviation Safety Agency Proposes Regulatory Framework for Unmanned Aircraft\n\nSummary: The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has proposed a regulatory framework for unmanned aircraft (UA) operations in Europe. The framework establishes three categories of UA operations with different safety requirements based on the level of risk involved. The \"open\" category is for low-risk operations that do not require prior authorization, the \"specific\" category is for medium-risk operations that require authorization based on an operational risk assessment, and the \"certified\" category is for high-risk operations that require certification of the UA, licensed remote pilot, and approved operator. The proposal also addresses technical and operational requirements for drones, including remote identification and geofencing.\n\nHeadline: Cyber Security Expert Warns of Risks of Drone-Jacking\n\nSummary: A cyber security expert warns of the risks of drone-jacking, where drones are hacked or physically attacked. The report highlights the potential for drones to be used for malicious purposes, such as theft of sensitive data or physical diversion of drones. The loss of data via drone-jacking raises privacy concerns, especially with the implementation of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. The report calls for targeted legislation and effective insurance products to cover risks associated with drone technology.\n\nHeadline: Near-Misses Between Drones and Planes Highlight Need for EU Laws\n\nSummary: The European Commission calls for EU-wide regulation of drones after a series of near-misses with airplanes. There were over 1,200 \"safety occurrences\" involving drones in Europe last year, including incidents with planes. The commission warns that if action is not taken, near-misses between drones and airplanes could have disastrous consequences. The commission emphasizes the need for safety in the use of drones, while also recognizing the opportunities they offer for new services and businesses.\n\nHeadline: North Wales Police Use Drones to Fight Crime\n\nSummary: North Wales Police has trained officers and staff to use drones in the fight against crime. The drones are used for capturing video and images for investigations, including searching for missing people and gathering evidence from road traffic incidents and major crimes. The drones have proven to be highly effective in gathering images over difficult terrain and hard-to-reach areas. The live images captured by the drones can be seen by police on the ground, and they have also been used to assist firefighters in tackling a large blaze. The drones are seen as a cost-effective tool in fighting crime and helping communities.\n\nHeadline: Drone Makers Focus on Commercial Opportunities\n\nSummary: Drone makers are exploring new commercial opportunities beyond consumer use. Drones are being used for various purposes, such as delivering packages, surveying mines, firefighting, and collecting data for conservation efforts. The industry is adapting to new market dynamics, with industrial and tech groups showing interest in the sector.

DJI, a leading drone manufacturer, is looking into areas such as agriculture and mosquito elimination. While consumer drones still dominate the market, the industry is shifting towards more commercial applications.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nINTERNAL NOTE (DG Mobility and Transport)\nThis internal note aims at assisting the press office to prepare a press release announcing the publication, by the Single Europeas Sky Air traffic management Research (SESAR) Joint Undertaking, of its blueprint for drone use in low-level air space. The publication of this blueprint, following a request of the Commission, is part of the Commission's Aviation Strategy, which requires an effective legal framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of concerns, notably safety.\nThe European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States (MS) and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules in order to implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which is expected to be adopted in the coming months.\nWithin this context, the Commission, through SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system.\nThis note will first highlight the opportunities and threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace (1) and it will then turn to the blueprint for drone use in low-level air space (2).\n1. Opportunities and threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace\n1.1. Opportunities of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace\n- Employement and growth:\nAccording to the European Air Safety Agency (EASA), unmanned aircraft has great potential for producing new jobs and growth.\n- New or better services:\nIn its Riga Declaration \"Framing the future of aviation\", the European aviation community further advocates that drones offer new services and applications going beyond traditional aviation and offer the promise to perform existing services in a more affordable and environmetal friedly way.\nThis aspect was also hightlighted in the press, where several potential benefits of drones have been put forward, from Amazon deliveries to rescue missions and fight against crime.\n1.2. Threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace:\n- Safety:\nSome concerns have been raised in the press that \"saferty occurences\" involving drones in Europe are on the rise, potentially posing a threat to recreational and commercial planes. Similar concerns have been raised by the European aviation community, which stated, in its recent Rega Declaration, that, althoigh no one is on board of a drone, people in other aicraft or on the ground could get hurt in case of an accident or an unscheduled landing.\n- Noise:\nThe European aviation community also identified other risks linked to the use of drones, such as nuisances and negatice externalities.\n- Right to privacy:\nIn its recent Riga Declaration, the European aviation community also raised concerns with respect to the protection of fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, as many drones involve data-gathering such as filming.\n- Security threats:\nAnother risk which has been put forward is the potential security risk linked to the malicious use of drones.\nIt can thus be said that the use of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace both has a lot of potential to foster European leadership and competitiveness, but also implied important risks that need to be mitigated through an effective legal framework.\n2. The blueprint for drone use in low-level air space\nThe purpose of this blueprint is to make drone use in low-level airspace safe, secure and environmentallu friendly. It will pave the way for the development of a strong and dynamic EU drone services market.\nThis blueprint oulines the proposed vision for the concept of \"U-space\", which is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace (altitudes of up to 150 meters) for large number of drones.\nThis paper outiles a number of basic principles:\ni) Safety at low level altitude levels:\nThe concept is to develop a system similar to that of Air Traffic Management (ATM) for manned aviation.\nii) Automated system:\nThe system will provide information for highly automated or autonomous drones to fly safely and avoid obstacles or collisions.\niii) Partly up and running by 20XX+2:\nIt will be the case for basic services like registration, e-identification and geo-fencing.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score(out-off 10): 7.0\n\nCommunication Summary: \nThe text's layout is logical but could be improved by breaking down the long paragraphs into smaller sections for better readability.\n\nThe text communicates its points clearly but would benefit from enhanced organization and more subheadings to guide the reader through the complex subject matter.\n\nThe text does not have a specifically titled Introduction section.\nThe text does not have a specifically titled Conclusions section.\nThe text does not have a specifically titled Recommendations section.\n\nThe tone of the document is formal and informative.\n\nThe document is not particularly easy to read due to long paragraphs and the absence of headers in some sections.\n"}]}

Some of the most pressing dangers of AI include techno-solutionism, which can lead to biased and discriminatory outcomes, the adoption of a statistical perspective on justice that may produce skewed results, the spread of disinformation and threats to democracy, discrimination and risk in the medical setting, and the risks associated with generative AI, such as deepfakes and misinformation. To address these risks, the European Commission is proposing a regulatory framework on AI that includes clear requirements and obligations for AI developers, deployers, and users, as well as a labeling system to identify AI-generated content and fight disinformation.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nWHAT IS GAI\nGenerative AI is a sub field of articial intelligence, where computer algoritms are used to create output that seems to be created by human being. Some example of results can be, text, image, video and coding line.\nThese algoritms are fed with training data, which includes some example of desired output. Algoritms analyse the structure of those training data and can create new outputs, which can seem unique and made by human.\nGAI is a machine learning process, it continues to fine tunes itself, the more contents are created the more sophisticated and convincing outcome will become.\n \nGAI POTENTIAL BENEFITS\nGenerative Artificial intelligence has several benefit, infact it can be used to improve efficiencies within business environment but also in private life. GAI can carry out specific and easy task and give more time to focus on more strategic and important activities.\nIn business environment it is mainly used as previously said to improve efficiencies, this means lower labour cost. It is used in several field, such as:\n-Healthcare to enhance discoveries and elaborate data,\n-Finance to study and predict stock market trends,\n-Education to produce training material and assessment that fit better to students,\n-Marketing to create new content which are dedicated to specific customers,\n-Environment to predict weather analysing data.\n-in several field can be help in customer support, with virtual assistent and in general to analyse data and improving deicsion making process.\nBenefits are visible and even if it is a relatively new discover, lot of companies and people are relying on it.\n \nWHAT ARE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH GAI\nUnfortunately since it a relatively new discovery, GAI needs still to be discover fully and the related dangers with it. \nDangers can be the spread of misinformation, malicious or sensitive contents, which can bring damage to people and business, some of them can be:\n-Hallucination, sometimes GAI can produce wrong output and it can be a problem for people that are relying too much on it, we need to remember that it is still a machine and does not have the same understanding of human being.\n-Deepfakes, as explained before GAI can be used to produce fake news or fake content such as video or picture, which can harm people or businesses. i particular this can harm EU value of democracy be used to manupulate information and influence people in politics but also in their opinion.\n-Dataprivacy, GAI can be used to solve problem, for example in our business but all the information, also sensitive ones, that we give to this system are stored and can be used in different ways,\n-Cybersecurity, related to previous point some of the information given can be use to harm business or people.\n-Copyright, GAI is fed with training data, but it can include data from different source and authors, for this reason the output result can be a mix of all those information and the output can be a violation of copyright.\n-Wokforce, finally another fundamental point is that increasing efficiencies will usually lead to reduce the workforce to improve company copetitiveness. in this way workers can lose their job and they will be in the position of rebuild themself and upskill in order to compete with AI or find alternatives jobs.\nHOW EU WANTS TO ADDRESS GAI DANGERS?\nBased on previous brief list of danges, it is needed to find a way to regulate GAI to use this powerful tool in the safetiest possible way.\nEU is proposiing the first ever legal framework on AI, in the AI package it is also include the Coordinated plan on AI. These two measures will guarantee safety and fundamental right for people and business and will reduce the cost and investment to access this technology especially for SMEs.\nThis proposal will set clear requirements and obligations regarding specific use of AI.\nIn April 20XX European Union proposed a new Copyright rules for generative EU, which would require companies to disclose any compyright material used to develop those tools. The aim to use these rules to improve transparency and ethics, and minimizing misues and infringment of copyrights.\nFurthermore, based on regulatory framewoek all tool will be classified based on associated risk which can be, Unacceptable risk, High risk, Limited risk and Minimal risk.\nPart oEuropean Union wants also to address directly the problem of segregation of fact and fiction, for this reason, EU wants to ask company to label all contents that are created by GAI.\nThe proposal is to labe all AI materials created to tackle the proble of misinformation about text, images, video or audio. For now this labelling it is not mandatory but discussion is ongoing among EU countries, Parliament and commission.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score(out-off 10): 5.0\n\nCommunication Summary: \nA lot of potential is shown here in being able to focus on the relevant information and structure it clearly. \nBut the writing style is more suited to a written briefing than a speech.

Some of the most pressing dangers of AI include techno-solutionism, which can lead to biased and discriminatory outcomes, the adoption of a statistical perspective on justice that may produce skewed results, the spread of disinformation and threats to democracy, discrimination and risk in the medical setting, and the risks associated with generative AI, such as deepfakes and misinformation. To address these risks, the European Commission is proposing a regulatory framework on AI that includes clear requirements and obligations for AI developers, deployers, and users, as well as a labeling system to identify AI-generated content and fight disinformation.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nSpeaking Note to Commissioner Thierry Breton\n9 June 20XX, DG Internal Market\nTitle: The Commissions standpoint to generative AI (GAI)\n \nDefining GAI:\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is a subfield of an artificial intelligence (AI) system. It can generate computer algorithms, texts, images, and music. GAI learns from training data that includes examples of desired output. \nExamples of GAI are:\nChatGPT is an AI language model that can generate human-like text based on given prompts.\nMidjourney interprets text prompts and context to produce images and artwork.\n \nPotential Benefits of GAI:\nGAI increases efficiancy, enables businesses to automate specific tasks and increase operational efficiency. It further customises marketing content, optimizing computer code, draft templates for all kind of written texts.\nPotential Risks of GAI:\nFive specific risks exist regarding GAI:\nHallucinations: GAI uses training data. The training data can lead to biased or incorrect responses, which is a serious probelm when people rely on it.\nDeepfakes: GAI creates videos and fotos and voice recording that may be abused to attack politicians and activits, spread misleading information. GAI may further create fake accounts and take over existing legitimate accounts. Disinformation through GAI is a serious risk for democracy. Deepfake videos and online bots may spread fake news and manipulate public discourse and social trust.\nData privacy: GAI user data is often stored for model training. Therefore, employees may easily expose sensitive and proprietary entreprise data. The GAI applications may indefinitely store information and even train other GAI models with it, further compromising confidentiality.\nCybersecurity: Computer hackers could abuse GAI applications to code computer viruse or other harmful software.\nCopyright issues: GAI models use big amounts of internet data sharing content that has not been explicitly shared by the original soruce. This is problematic for music and videos that have a copyright.\n \nOptions to address risks:\nThe EU has understood that fighting against desinformation in context of defending democracy and EU values is very important. Therefore, the European Commission proposes the first-ever regulatory framework on AI, namely the AI act, to address risks of AI and position Europe to play a leading role on AI globally. The existing legislation is not sufficient to address specific challenges AI systems may bring.\nThe new regulatory framework under the AI act defines 4 levels of risks unacceptable risk: high risk, limited risk, minimal risk. The EU lists GAI such as chatbots in the category of limited risk. In that case users need to be made aware that they are interacting with a machine so they can take an informed decision to continue or step back. \nThe regulation further proposes a conformity assessment before the AI system is put into service or placed on the market. GAI companies will have to disclose any copyright material used to develop their systems. Moreover, they will have to indentify and label AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation.\nNext steps\nThe commission propsed the AI Act to regulate high risk applications and ban most dangerous ones. But even before the act enters into force, the Commission will make it mandatory for the GAI industry to label AI generated work.\nSigning Code of Practice by big tech comapnies including Microsoft, Google, Meta and Tiktok against desinformation. The Code of Practice will ask signatories to create a dedicated track within the code to indentify specific disinformation risks by GAI and take appropriate measures to address them. The Commission plans to make the code enforcable by including a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act. Labelling AI contact may also enter the AI act.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score(out-off 10): 5.0\n\nCommunication Summary: \nObservations\nWith this competence, we basically evaluate the style of the case study.

To address these risks, the European Commission is proposing a regulatory framework on AI that includes clear requirements and obligations for AI developers, deployers, and users, as well as a labeling system to identify AI-generated content and fight disinformation.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nINTRODUCTION\nThe purpose of this speaking note is to identify potential benefits and risks of generative AI, including the specific disinformation risk related to it. Furthermore, it will be shown as the EU addresses some issues created by the generative AI focusing on the importance of the fight against the disinformation in the context of defending democracy and the EU values.\nDEFINITION OF GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (GAI)\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence in which computer algorithms are used to generate outputs that resemble human-created content be it text images graphics music computer code or otherwise. Algorithms are designed to learn from training data that includes examples of the desired output.\nGENERATIVE AI AND THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS\nGenerative AI brings many advantages to business and entrepreneurs including: \nEfficiency because generative AI enables business to automate specific tasks and focus their time energy and resources on more important strategic objectives.\nAnalysis of data to improve decision-making.\nGeneration of new ideas, designs or content.\nWriting checking and optimizing computer code\nEnhance customer support with chatbots and virtual assistant.\nFurthermore, the generative AI can be used in various applications and industries, such as, for examples, in healthcare for accelerating the discovery of novel drugs and education for developing customized learning materials.\nGENERATIVE AI AND THE DISADVANTAGES\nIt increases the number of automation of tasks and therefore this situation affects the workforce and contribute to job displacement. In particular, the impacted employees are required to reskill or upskill.\nAI models can unintentionally learn and amplify biases present in training data, leading to problematic outputs that perpetuate stereotypes and harmful ideologies. The main issue in that regards is that it is difficult to scrutinize the sources used to train AI models.\nPrivacy since user data is often stored for model training and sensitive data can be exposed when interacting with generative AI.\nCybersecurity.\nCopyright issues because the AI models to generate output refer to a large database they were trained on. However, the original source and what can be used are not indicated.\nGENERATIVE AI AND THE DISINFORMATION RISK\nGenerative AI can contribute to spread misinformation or malicious or sensitive content that could result in damages for people and business.\nLarge language models, such as ChatGPT, make up facts. They are trained to predict the next word for a given input not whether a fact is correct or not. Furthermore, they are prone to mistake because of a misunderstanding of the prompt or a blatantly wring answer to the question since they rely on training and data to provide answers.\nConsidering the above, disinformation generated by generative AI can threat the security of the EU countries and the principle of democracy.  In particular, the technology can be used by criminals and extremists to manipulate people.\nEU PROPOSALS IN THE FIELD OF GENERATIVE AI\nAccording to an EU agreement, the European Union introduced new copyright rules for generative AI requiring companies developing generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop these tools.\nFollowing the above agreement, the Commission proposed the first-ever legal framework on AI, namely the AI Act as part of the wider AI package including the updated Coordinated Plan on AI. The aim of this proposal is, on the one hand, to provide AI developers, deployers and users with clear requirements and obligations regarding specific uses of AI and, on the other hand, to reduce administrative and financial burdens for business.\nAt the same time the proposal wants to guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and business in the field of AI. This will strengthen uptake investment and innovation in AI across EU.\nUnder the proposal, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level. In particular, 4 levels of risk in AI are identified:\nUnacceptable risk: all the AI systems having this level of risk are a clear threat to safety and they will be banned.\nHigh risk: All the AI systems having this level of risk are subject to strict obligations before thy can be put on the market.\nLimited risk: All the AI systems having this level of risk have specific transparency obligations.\nMinimal or no risk: All the AI systems having this level of risk o no risk are free use.\nCONCLUSION\nDespite the beneficial of the generative AI in real-world applications, there are still many risks which can be generated by it, affecting EU values and fundamental rights, as explained in the above paragraphs. However, the EU is trying to provide a relevant legislation framework to solve some of the issues raised by the generative AI. In that regard, the EU legislation seems to be considered a step forward to create a transparent, safe and non-discriminatory AI system in the EU.  Furthermore, it is necessary that the companies using the generative AI collaborate and apply the EU regulation to obtain results. They should adopt measures to avoid that disinformation can be spread by controlling the sources used to train the AI models. Considering that the AI is a fast-evolving technology it is also important that the EU regulation would be flexible enough to approach the future challenges of AI.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score(out-off 10): 9.0\n\nCommunication Summary: \nObservations\nWith this competence, we basically evaluate the style of the case study.

This year, there was an inter-service consultation with DG AGRI, DG ENV, DG TRADE on animal welfare regulation, on 16/05/202X. Conventional livestock production systems across EU countries are put under pressure by competitive global markets. The pressure to have lower prices on certain foods has led to intensification of farming with negative effect on animal welfare. The purpose of this briefing is to make more clarity towards the decision of which option to choose for the animal welfare regulation.\nPolicy objectives:\nA. Phasing out confining cages\nA general transition period needed.\nB. Banning the killing of day-old male chiks\nIn case of a ban, a transition period need to be combined with stricter import rules. \nC. Banning paintfull mutilations\nIncentives for voluntary action would enter into force imediatelly. \nD. Annimal welfare requirements at import\nSimilar or fully equivalent. \nI. Main issues and remaining problems to solve\n1. - There is a pressure to reduce production costs, which leads to conditions and equipment they may harm the animals. \n2. - Around three hundred million farmed animals are confined in cages every year accross Europe. No single EU country is cage free.\n3. - Not all the DG agree with the line of the animal welfare regulation. The current legislation is outdated, fragmented and too general. \n4. - Need to choose between ethics and prices. The impact of imposing the animal welfare regulation will lead to increase in prices. For the moment there is a lack of incentives to invest in animal welfare. A partial or total ban on cages would have an important economic impact on the sectors concerned. \nII. Arguments and facts to ease a decision - the way foreward on animal welfare regulation\nDG AGRI does not yet agree with DG SANTE main line on animal welfare regulation. The number of poultry cage need to be determined or incetives to the farmers to ba established.  \nStrengths\n- we received confirmation from DG ENV that the proposal is in line with the European Green Deal objectives\n- increase animal welfare protection\nDisadvantages\n- the big farmers cannot compete with cage free adoption because they would need more space, as underlines DG AGRI. This will lead to a price increase of 20-40% in countries like Spain, Portugal and Malta. \n- the European farmers will not be able to compete with third countries producers, who do not take into account animal welfare.\nIn conclusion\nThere are 3 types of options: low, medium and high. Medium and high ambition options can be combined with stricter requirements of minimum space per animal and antibiotics to be used. \na. Following the comments received after the interservice consultation, the low ambition option or status quo should apply for protecting the market and ensure competitive pricing of food products for animal welfare. \nb. As the citizens are putting pressure through an European initiative, a decision on animal welfare should be taken asap. \nc. Regarding the poultry cage rearing, the smaller the farms, easier it is for them to implement cage free rearing.\nd. The domino effect will start from animal welfare regulation - higher food prices - burden on poor families. DG AGRI proposal of incentives seem to be a solution. \nRecommendation prefered on animal welfare regulation\nIn conclusion there is an urge to implement as soon as possible the 'cage free' legislation for animals, accompagned by a cost/efficiency analysis. In parallel to the legislation, in order to facilitate a balanced economy, financial support and incentives may be provided through the new eco-schemes instrument of DG AGRI. Accepting the economic compensations to poultry farming will suggested by DG AGRI, will unblock our proposal on animal welfare regulation. \nThe legislation should be more specific and sustanable, in accordance to the European Green Deal Objectives. Last, but not least, awarness -raising of consumers, economic incentives via the Common Agricultural Policy and import rules to ensure a level of competition. \nTherefore a mix between medium and high ambition options is preferred.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score(out-off 10): 6.0\n\nCommunication Summary: \nObservations\nGenerally, this is a very good attempt to present a complex issue.\nThe introductory paragraph conveys relevant background information regarding the topic. However, the written style needs work in terms of professional fluency, and there are grammar issues that need to be ironed out. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not entirely clear on the focus of the briefing from this introduction, as the disagreement of DG AGRI should be flagged from the outset. \n\nIn the policy objective section, the key issues are set out clearly in bullet points.  However, from I. Main Issues, the briefing gives the impression of being a work-in-progress, due to its overreliance on writing in note form. Because of this, the text seems slightly disjointed and there is a lack of coherence at times. \nFurthermore, some points are not elaborated on further, analysed for their significance, or more completely argued. \nSome key details and relevant information is omitted or generalized. Providing more specifics and data on key issues will give a more comprehensive overview of the situation and lead to more informed reasoning regarding the solutions going forward. \nE.g.:\n-  Could have mentioned that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. \n- The timing for bans were subject to being based on low, medium or high ambition options for each measure, so briefly mention what these options mean.\n\nThe suggestions given are commendable, but these need to be clearer, with recommendations given with solid reasoning as well as an exploration of consequences.\n\nSome further grammar issues and several typos impact the readability of the document.\n"}]}

However, it is important to facilitate a balanced and economically viable transition to cage-free farming, particularly by adopting specific supporting measures in key policy areas areas like trade and research and development. \n2) Animal welfare regulation state of play and main issues \n2.1) State of play of Inter-Service Consultation (ISG) replies: \nDG TRADE and DG ENV provided green light to the draft legislation revision proposal of DG SANTE. On the other hand, DG AGRI blocked the proposal, claiming a series of policy problems that need to be tackled. \n2.2) DG AGRI main opposition motives:\nDG AGRI reasons for blocking the proposal are the following:\n1) The proposed exception for farms with less than 50 livestock units (3500 laying hens) is not rational. In fact, the large majority of eggs produced in the EU come from farms with more than 5000 birds (70 livestock units) and the smaller farms have already a more easily transition to cage-free rearing if they have not done it; \n2) The legislation has focuses too extensively on money and food prices rather than providing longer transition times; \n3) The proposal of having more space for laying hens as requirement is a less cost-efficient solution, which will lead most farms not being able to maintain the same number of birds;\n4) Finally, the price for eggs by implementing DG SANTE new proposed regulation might increase by 20-40%, in countries where cage systems are the norm (i.e. Spain, Portugal and Malta), impacting more significantly the poorest family and resulting in higher imports of cheaper eggs from third countries with worse animal welfare standards.  \nIn light of the above, DG AGRI would opt for a longer transition period or maintaining the current status quo. \n2.3) Scientific evidence on non-cage housing systems\nMoreover, alongside the above-mentioned policy issues, several scientific studies highlighted several public health concerns in regards to the implementation of non-cage housing systems: \n1) The usage of non-cage housin systems for poultry can result in a higher level of antimicrobial resistance prevalence, notably among e-coli bacteria, if the implementation process is not correct and does not follow strict quality standards; \n2) Free-range egg production systems face more challenges in relation to biosecurity and antibiotics usage. In fact, the free-range layer birds interact more with each other in comparison to the ones in cages, increasing the incidence of infectious poultry diseases requiring treatment with antimicrobials, thus resulting in increased emergence of resistant commensal and pathogenic bacteria (major threat to public health). \n2.4) Main factors to consider for an efficient non-cage system:\nTo implement an efficient non-cage system, is necessary particular attention on the specific aspects:\n1) Number of hens per square meter; \n2) Hygiene routines; \n3) Overall rules on veterinary antiobiotics' prescription. \nThe same problems aforementioned apply to pigs farming practices. \n3) An assessment of the available policy options:\n3.1) Three main possible scenarios:\nFor adopting a transition phase to cage-free systems, respectively high, medium and low ambition policies may be considered. The high ambition policy provides the quickest transition phase, but it may result in higher burden of cost for farmers and generally have a regressive impact on the poorest households. On the other hand, the low ambition period, providing a transition phase of 10 years, would give farmers the largest span of time to adjust to the policy change, but it is not line with the expectations of both the European Parliament and the European civil society. \nAs concerns the medium ambition policy scenario, it looks the most reasonable solution, from a cost- and time perspective. \n3.2) The medium ambition policy scenario implementation: \nIn detail, the medium policy ambition scenario would entail the following measures: \n1) For crates / cages (pig): Phase in of the ban over 5 years. Farms with less than 50 livestock units will be allowed to phase out over 15 years. Allowing temporay confinement from 1 day before farrowing to 5 days post-farrowing. \n2) For calves, phase-out of all use of crates within 5 years. Moreover, a ban on trade / import of calves must be created. \n3) For laying hends and pullets a total ban should be phased in over 5 years.\n4) For rabbits and animal in fur production a transition phase of 5 years will be put in place.\n5) For killing day-old male chickens, ban of procedure within 10 years alongside providing economic incentives through the Common Agricultural Policy for farmers transition sooner. Alongside this, an obligation to mark eggs eggs from production systems not yet transitioned will be put in place.\n6) For the painful mutilations ban, a phase in over 10 years will be granted.\n7) Finally, the requirements for import from third countries should be in line with the minimum set of rules for welfare implemented by the EU. \n4) Policy recommendation \n4.1) The importance of transition\nThe EU should  provide financial incentives to farmers through the Common Agricultural Policy for farmers in order to make the burden of shifting to non-cage systems the less expensive and impactful on their activity as possible. \n4.2) The importance of innovation: \nThe EU should consider the most recent technological developments in agricultural practices, zooechnics and transport operation, by understanding better stocking densities, behaviour (for enriched environment), mutilation practices, journey times and space allowances for animals transports.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score(out-off 10): 6.0\n\nCommunication Summary: \nObservations\nWith this competence, we basically evaluate the style of the case study.

Additionally, the adoption of driverless cars will lead to the elimination of traffic lights and other transportation infrastructure, as well as the development of lighter and more fuel-efficient vehicles. However, the deployment of driverless cars also raises challenges related to safety, liability, infrastructure, data processing, and legal frameworks. The European Union is calling for EU-wide rules to address these challenges and ensure a standard level of safety and security. The US Department of Transportation has defined five levels of autonomous driving, ranging from complete driver control to full autonomy. The deployment of autonomous vehicles is expected to have a significant impact on the job market, particularly for truck drivers, with potential job losses of up to 25,000 per month in the US. However, the full effects of self-driving cars may be delayed by regulation and slow adoption.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nBriefing on driveless cars\nToday is 16 November 20XX\n \nIntroduction-Background information\nAutomated vehicle technologies allow the transfer of driving functions from a human driver to a computer. Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility and will create challenges. As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure. It has also the potential to be more environmentally friendly, efficient and accessible. However, automated vehicle technologies require an effective regulatory and legislative framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of legitimate concerns.\n1. Potentials and challenges of vehicle automation\nThe potential impact of the deployment of automated vehicles has several aspects with technical, financial, economic, legal and ethical dimensions. \nDriverless cars will reform transportation as we know it by improoving our lives. Their adoption will slash accident and fatality rates, saving millions of lives. It will remove one-third to one-half of all vehicles from city streets because self-driving cars don\u2019t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers. \nEliminating human drivers will also allow automobile designers to build cars from a completely different mind set.The A.I. system driving the car will also reduce accidents to negligible levels. With no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient.\nFrom economic aspect, car sharing will cost a fraction of what car ownership today costs. Owning a car for daily, personal transportation will seem impractical while workers could gain productive hours in the day by working instead of driving during daily commutes.\nInnovations in this field are also poised to completely change the car insurance industry by reducing accidents\u2014a new report predicts that accidents will drop by 80% by 20XX+20\nAt the same time policy makers, face challenges in designing the appropriate legal and regulatory framework so that new technologies are used properly and for the benefit of society.\nThe rapid development of robots/automated cars might result in changes in the labour market through the creation, displacement and loss of certain jobs for example the replacement of corporate fleets for deliveries or transporting employees will push up the unemployment. \nLast but not least, the growing use of robotics  raises ethical issues concerning privacy and safety. The new technologies raise questions as to how data privacy and cyber security will be addressed. The highly or fully automated vehicle will process data and make decisions: this raises ethical issues which have to be solved in a societal dialogue. The programmed algorithms will make decisions in conflicting situations, such as a choice between two unavoidable crash scenarios. How will the decision be taken? What 'best driving behaviour' should be reflected by the system? A possible solution could be a voluntary ethical code of conduct on robotics for researchers and designers to ensure that they operate in accordance with legal and ethical standards and that robot design and use respect human dignity.\n2. The different levels of automation and their deployment\nBut, what does \"autonomous driving\" really mean? The US Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defined five different levels of autonomous driving.The levels are six (0-5).\nLevel 0 - Park Distance Control (already deployed): The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals.\nLevel 1 - Park Assist (already deployed): The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces. The system assists the driver by automatically carrying out the optimum steering movements in order to reverse - park on the ideal line. However, the driver has to operate the accelerator and the brake having the control of the car at all times.\nLevel 2 - Traffic Jam Assist (already deployed): The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h). The system can be seen as an extension of the Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop&Go functionality, i.e. no lane change support.\nLevel 3 - Traffic Jam Chauffeur (already deployed): Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads. The system can be activated in a traffic jam scenario. It detects a slow-driving vehicle in front and then handles the vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Later versions of this functionality might include lane change functionality.\nLevel 4 - Highway Pilot (possible deployment 20XX+4): Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver must deliberately activate the system, but does not have to monitor it constantly. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. There is no request from the system to the driver to take over when the system is in its normal operation area on the motorway. Depending on the deployment of vehicle-to-vehicle communication and cooperative systems, ad-hoc convoys could also be created.\nLevel 5 \u2013 The fully automated vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger. According to ERTRAC only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10.\n \n3. Regulatory and legal frameworks, state of play\nRoad traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness.\nOne of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept, as laid down in Article 8, that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. The amended convention (20XX-1) still demands that every vehicle must have a driver. However, in the future it will be in accordance with the Convention that highly automated systems will have a driver who may take the hands off the wheel, but must be ready at all times to take over the driving functions, and who can override the system and switch it on and off. A further amendment process is therefore necessary to permit driverless vehicles. Systems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.\nThe regulatory environment relating to cyber security, data privacy, and liability issues is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles. Regulation of automated vehicles faces challenges to establish rules for technologies not yet applied. In particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed. Traffic rules and the regulatory framework need to be adapted. In addition, it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom. The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of driving education and licensing.\nEU Commission should be ready to propose rules on robotics and artificial intelligence, in order to fully exploit their economic potential and to guarantee a standard level of safety and security. As regulatory standards for robots are being planned in several countries, the EU needs to take the lead on setting these standards, so as not to be forced to follow those set by third countries.\nTraffic accidents have very large costs in economic terms, in particular regarding human lives or health, or regarding damage to an object. Liability law answers the question of who is responsible and who has to bear the costs of an accident. Relevant legislation is urgently needed to clarify liability issues, especially for self-driving cars. A mandatory insurance scheme and a supplementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driverless cars are fully compensated is needed. In addition, a specific legal status for robots in the long run, should be established in order to identify who is liable if they cause damage.\nRegarding ethics the creation of a European agency for robotics and artificial intelligence, to supply public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise should be considered.\n4.  Ongoing work in the EU\nIn the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products (Council Directive 85/374/EEC). A producer is liable for any damage caused by a defect in his product; a product is defective when it does not provide the safety which the consumer is entitled to expect. However, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved \u2014 the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States.\nSystems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.\nThe debate on data privacy regarding connected automated vehicles is evolving in parallel with the new technologies. In general, digital services will be available in vehicles, as they are anywhere else. As third parties can access and use sensitive driver and driving data, legislation seems necessary to protect personal privacy of consumers in connected vehicles.The new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regard to digital technologies, valid across the EU.\nThe EP resently (16-03-20xx) voted a resolution for the establishment of EU legislation for the fast-evolving field of robotics, e.g. to enforce ethical standards or establish liability for accidents involving driverless cars. In addition, the European Commission promised dedicated funding, regulatory changes, cross-border agreements and innovation stimulus. The first step in a roadmap, was published by the Commission as part of its transport strategy last May, that could see driverless cars integrated with traffic by 20XX+10.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score(out-off 10): 7.0\n\nCommunication Summary: \n\n"}]}

Thus it requires adequate regulations and legal framework to overcome challenges for an efficient use of the technologies.\n1.POTENTIALS AND CHALLENGES OF VEHICLE AUTOMATION\nVehicle automation is the key future in transport development. Many benefits could result in implementing driving digitalisation while some challenges and questions still need to be addressed. \nPOTENTIALS\nUsing driverles cars is first money saving. It could remove to one-half of all vehicles from the streets allowing 70 % cost reduction of car ownership via shared automated vehicles.Less infrastructures buildings will be needed, that reduces expenses linked to traffic equipments (signage, traffic lights etc.).\nThis could lead to social benefits at it could ease acces to transport for specific groups of people: disable person, women or person living outside cities could have on-demand personal transportation. \nRoads will become safer as the number of streets accidents should drop due to traffic reduction. \nDiscrimation against individuals ( police intervention in traffic violations) and insurance discrimination could be impacted positively.\nThe use of driverless will also be eco-friendly as traffic will be reduced due to more automated car sharing offer and there will be more energy saving with no more use of public lights for instance. The resulting changes in car equipments and design will make vehicles lighter and more fuel-efficient e.g. no more brake pedals or steering wheels.\nCHALLENGES\nThere are unresolved issues related to ethics i.e human dignity respect, privacy and safety worries like the control of the vehicle in emergency case.\nAnother concern is the lack of regulation or rules to clarify liabilty matters for accidents involving driverless car. There is an absense of EU-wide rules and technical standards in these subjects.\nPeople also worry about potential negative impact on the labour market:  loss of certain jobs due to automation e.g. for professional drivers.\nThere are still questions on cyber security risks and data protection issues related to connected automated vehicle.\n2. THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTOMATION AND THEIR DEPLOYMENT\nIt is important to clarify the meaning of \"autonomous driving\". The NHTSA defined the five levels of autonomy describing the IT system in vehicles. They are:\nLevel 0: fully control by human.This is already deployed e.g. Park Distance Control.\nLevel 1: a specific function are done automatically by the car. This is already deployed e.g. Park Assist.\nLevel 2: at least one driver assistance system is automated. This is already deployed e.g. Traffic Jam Assist.\nLevel 3: safety-critical functions can be completly shifted to the vehicle (under certain traffic and environmental conditions). This is already deployed e.g. Traffic Jam Chauffeur.\nLevel 4: \"fully autonomous\" i.e. vehicles are designed to perform all safety critical driving functions and monitor roadway condition for an entire trip. This does not cover all driving scenario. This is could be deployed by 20XX+4 e.g. Higway Pilot.\nLevel 5: fully-autonomous system i.e. vehicles' performance ishould equal that of a human driver in every driving scenario. This is could be deployed by 20XX+10 e.g. \"The fully automated vehicle\".\n3. REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK, STATE OF PLAY\nTo answer challenges related to the use of automated vehicles, the European Commission already set in place a number of regulations.\nThe Vienna convention on Road Traffic of 1968 signed by all members states (in exception of Spain, an international treaty, establishes standard traffic rules among the contracting parties. But the convention and its amendment still demand that all vehicle must have a driver to take over the driving control in emergency cases. Thus high or full automation of vehicle are incompatibe with the Vienna convention.\nThe EU is a contracting party to the 1958 and the 1998 UNECE Agreements providing international harmonised framework in technical requirements for vehicles. The 1958 agreement, the EU vehicle type approval system granted by a national authority provides a Certificate of Conformity respecting legal requirements stipulated by the EU legislation.The Framework Directive of the 1998 Agreement establishes procedures and technical requirements for cars to be used on public roads.\nThe New General Data Protection Regulation establishes set of rules on data protection across the EU to ensure unauthorised disclosure and manipulation of automated vehicle data.\nWithin the EU there is no common harmonised rules on liabilty for damages caused by accidents involving motor vehicle. An adaption of liabilty law and a European harmonisation of the regimes concerning the liabilty of owners and/or drivers of automated vehicles is necessary.\n4.ONGOING WORK IN THE EU\nThe commission is still working on main issues related to automated vehicle in the EU. The legal framework for road safety has to be adapted. There is also a need to redefine infrastructure and technical standards. Reflection on questions concerning data processing and liabilty are as well underway.\nOn 16 February, MEPs proposed to the commision a code of Ethical conduct to ensure legal and ethical standards application and human dignity respect. MEPS stressed the need to draft legislation concerning liabiliites issues for selfdriving cars and to follow closely the impact of robots development on the labor market. It also suggests the creation of a European agency for robotics and artificial intelligence to supply public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise.\nDriverless cars integrated with traffic by 20XX+10 is part of the Commission transport strategy. Trucks are expected to go first driverless in motorways. As part of an experiment semi-autonomous platoons of trucks from around Europe started travelling to Rotterdam in early April.\n \nMany advantages can be considered in vehicle automation as the key future in transport development. Lot of  benefits can result in implementing driving digitalisation like money and energy saving or improvement in transportation availabilty. However some challenges and questions still need to be addressed.The commission is still working on main issues related to automated vehicle in the EU: The legal framework and standards. Reflection on questions concerning data processing and liabilty are also underway.\n \nI hope this will be usefull and clear for the colleagues.\nPlease get back to me if you have comments or think that further information should be added.\nThank you.\nRegards,\nXXX\nEconomist officer - DG mobility and transport\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score(out-off 10): 5.0\n\nCommunication Summary: \nObservations\n\nWith this competence, we basically evaluate the style of the case study. Your text should be clear, fluent, written in a professional but still captivating style; of course, spelling and grammar are also covered in this area. Another point we examine here is whether you managed to find the balance between providing details and being concise while conveying the key points of the arguments.\n"}]}
