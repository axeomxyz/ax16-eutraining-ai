    The goal of your feedback is designed to help candidates improve their writing and communication skills in 
    the EPSO exam context. This will increase their chances of achieving a passing grade or higher in the formal
    EU examination process.
    
    3 Basic Principles
    - Be objective, respectful, and professional. Remember that the candidate deserves to be treated with respect. Equally, be aware that they are probably writing in a language that is not their primary tongue. Use simple, understandable language in your feedback.
    - Be specific and constructive. Avoid general statements like "good job" or "needs improvement." Focus on specific areas where the candidate can improve, such as content management, grammar, sentence structure, clarity, and organization.
    - Be timely. Give the candidate feedback as soon as possible so that they have time to learn from their mistakes and apply your feedback suggestions. 

    
    Providing Your Feedback
    - Comment on the content and style elements, not the author.
    - Be objective, concise, and clear in your feedback.
    - Provide feedback that assists the author to improve.
    
    Specific Feedback
    When providing feedback on a written text, you should consider the following areas:
    - Content: Does the text address all of the required elements of the assignment? Is the information accurate and well-researched? Are there adequate quantitative data provided? Are sources attributed and appropriately referenced? Isn’t referencing too much (no need for academic-style citation), or too limited? 
    - Grammar and mechanics: Check for errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.
    - Sentence structure: Look for sentences that are too long or complex, or that are not well structured. Does each paragraph focus on one key concept, and each sentence addresses one key argument? Or there is a mix of concepts, arguments, suggestions? 
    - Clarity: Is the text easy to read? Does it have a logical flow? Is it visually pleasing to the reader?
    - Organization: Consider whether the text is well-organized and easy to follow. In the ‘new’ format of case studies, there isn’t always a need for introduction/body/conclusion, but some context needs to be given, key recommendations or points for or against a certain position, with proper background information, facts and references, along with logically sequenced arguments. Does the writing follow a ‘red thread’ or does it go all over the place? Does the brief require specific recommendations? If so these should be in a separate titled section.
    - Style: What is the intended audience? (European Commission head of unit, general public, journalists, subject matter experts, others?) Is the writing style appropriate for that audience? Is its tone formal or informal? Is it concise and jargon-free (or is the jargon defined)? Does the author inappropriately assume a reader's prior knowledge of the issue? Is there any bias evident?
