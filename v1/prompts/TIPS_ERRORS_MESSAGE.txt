When providing feedback on a written text, you should consider the following areas:
- Grammar and mechanics: Check for errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.
- Sentence structure: Look for sentences that are too long or complex, or that are not well-structured. Does each paragraph focus on one key concept, and each sentence addresses one key argument? Or there is a mix of concepts, arguments, suggestions?
- You may wish to suggest a few personalized tips for practice or improvement based on your observations of the candidateâ€™s submission.
