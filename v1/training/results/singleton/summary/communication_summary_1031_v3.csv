Summary:
Your memo provides a clear overview of the background and main issues related to the European Union's efforts to build a resilient lithium supply chain. You highlight the potential challenges arising from the classification of lithium salts as hazardous for human health and the competition from the US Inflation Reduction Act. Your proposed way forward suggests aligning the attractiveness of the EU market with the US through incentives and integrating the regulation with a system that values production chains compliant with EU requirements. However, there are areas where you can improve the clarity, organization, and style of your memo.

Clarity:
- The memo generally presents the information in a clear manner, but there are some areas where the language could be more concise and precise. For example, in the background section, instead of stating ""The goals of the European green deal and other climate change policies have underlined the strategic role plaied by batteries on reaching the environmental objectives,"" you can simply state ""Batteries play a strategic role in achieving the environmental objectives of the European Green Deal and other climate change policies.""
- In the main issues section, you mention that ""The global lithium demand will increase enormously in the next decade, and the global offer of lithium might not keep up the speed of the demand."" It would be helpful to provide some data or evidence to support this statement and make it more persuasive.

Organization:
- The organization of the memo could be improved to provide a clearer structure and flow of information. Consider using subheadings or bullet points to break down the different sections and make it easier for the reader to navigate through the memo.
- The agenda section is a good addition, but it would be beneficial to provide more specific recommendations or proposals under each agenda item to align the original proposal with the co-legislators' priorities.

Style:
- The tone of your memo is appropriate for the audience, and you use formal language throughout. However, there are some areas where the language could be more concise and jargon-free. For example, instead of using phrases like ""In fact, from the adoption of the regulation by the Commission, the context is changed,"" you can simply state ""Since the adoption of the regulation by the Commission, the context has changed.""
- Be mindful of sentence structure and grammar. For example, in the sentence ""Therefore we must value the production made in the EU and grant an incentive for each major stage of the production process,"" it would be clearer to say ""Therefore, we must value the production made in the EU and grant incentives for each major stage of the production process.""

Overall, your memo provides a good foundation, but it would benefit from improvements in clarity, organization, and style. Consider revising and refining your content to ensure a more effective communication of your proposals and recommendations.",3508,592

Summary Feedback:

The trainee's answer provides a summary of the main points from the case study, including the opportunities and threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace, and the blueprint for drone use in low-level airspace. The summary is clear and covers the key information from the case study.

However, there are a few areas where the trainee's answer could be improved:

1. Clarity: The trainee's answer is generally clear and easy to follow. However, there are a few instances where the language could be simplified and made more concise. For example, instead of saying ""This paper outlines a number of basic principles"", the trainee could say ""The blueprint outlines several key principles"".

2. Organization: The trainee's answer is well-organized and follows a logical structure. The summary is divided into two sections, one for the opportunities and threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles and one for the blueprint for drone use in low-level airspace. However, it would be helpful to use subheadings or bullet points to make the organization even clearer.

3. Style: The trainee's answer uses a formal writing style, which is appropriate for the audience. The language is mostly clear and jargon-free, but there are a few instances where the trainee could use simpler language. For example, instead of saying ""The delivery of U-space relies upon the following key principles"", the trainee could say ""The implementation of U-space is based on the following key principles"".

Overall, the trainee's answer provides a good summary of the case study, but there is room for improvement in terms of clarity, organization, and style.",4210,376

Observations
Generally, this is a very good attempt to present a complex issue.
The introductory paragraph conveys relevant background information regarding the topic. However, the written style needs work in terms of professional fluency, and there are grammar issues that need to be ironed out. 

Also, Iâ€™m not entirely clear on the focus of the briefing from this introduction, as the disagreement of DG AGRI should be flagged from the outset. 

In the policy objective section, the key issues are set out clearly in bullet points.  However, from I. Main Issues, the briefing gives the impression of being a work-in-progress, due to its overreliance on writing in note form. Because of this, the text seems slightly disjointed and there is a lack of coherence at times. 
Furthermore, some points are not elaborated on further, analysed for their significance, or more completely argued. 
Some key details and relevant information is omitted or generalized. Providing more specifics and data on key issues will give a more comprehensive overview of the situation and lead to more informed reasoning regarding the solutions going forward. 
E.g.:
-  Could have mentioned that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- The timing for bans were subject to being based on low, medium or high ambition options for each measure, so briefly mention what these options mean.

The suggestions given are commendable, but these need to be clearer, with recommendations given with solid reasoning as well as an exploration of consequences.

Some further grammar issues and several typos impact the readability of the document.

Summary:
According to the provided content, the trainee's answer does provide a summary of the main issues and remaining problems related to the animal welfare legislative proposal. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the clarity, organization, and style of the response.

Clarity:
- The trainee's answer lacks a clear introduction and background section. It is important to provide a brief overview of the topic and the context of the briefing note.
- The information provided in the trainee's answer is not well-structured and lacks coherence. It is important to present the main issues and arguments in a logical and organized manner.

Organization:
- The trainee's answer does not clearly separate the main issues and remaining problems. It is important to present each issue in a separate paragraph or section to improve readability and clarity.
- The trainee's answer does not provide clear recommendations or options for the way forward. It is important to clearly outline the different options and provide specific recommendations for the Director-General's decision.

Style:
- The trainee's answer lacks a formal and concise writing style. It is important to use appropriate language and tone for a briefing note intended for the Director-General.
- The trainee's answer includes unnecessary information and repetitions. It is important to focus on the main issues and arguments, and avoid unnecessary details or repetitions.

Based on the above observations, here are a few top-level suggestions for improvements:
- Start with a clear introduction and background section to provide context for the briefing note.
- Separate the main issues and remaining problems into separate paragraphs or sections.
- Clearly outline the different options for the way forward and provide specific recommendations.
- Use a formal and concise writing style appropriate for a briefing note.
- Avoid unnecessary information and repetitions.

Observations
Although written in a pleasing style, the briefing document would have benefitted from a clearer structure. 
E.g., introduction & background/ main issues /options for the way forward & recommendations/ conclusion. 

The candidate has successfully identified the main areas of concern and offered some recommendations. But some of the information towards the end of the document would have worked better in the introduction/background section where it could have provided better context.

The issue with DG AGRI should have been flagged immediately and expanded upon.

The candidate has made an effort to explain the low, medium and high ambition options that the legislative proposal is based on, as well as the main issues involved. Perhaps these issues could have been listed in a clearer way. 
E.g.:
The legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: 
1.	restricting the use of cages/crates;
2.	ending the killing of day-old male chickens;
3.	banning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and
4.	setting animal welfare requirements at import.

Overall, the main issues section needs to be expanded to detail the support from other DGs, as well as the concern and viewpoints of DG AGRI and DG SANTE.

The candidate has done a good job in summarizing some key issues in relation to space requirement concerns and that farmers would need to be compensated. The risk of unfair competition from third countries is mentioned but not fully explored.

Would also have been useful to touch on the following points:

E.g.:
- Perhaps mention that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- Also, could expand by explaining that it is not the main issue for small farmers, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. 
- Additionally, that for several member states, the cage ban will make no difference as they have already adopted the ban with national legislation. The cage ban therefore helps create a more level playing field. 

In the recommendations section, there are some good suggestions made. But overall, there is a tendency to veer towards being too concise, to the detriment of the briefing. Fully expand on the reasoning behind taking different options.

Could have also included more concrete options for the way forward in reaching an agreement with DG AGRI. 

E.g.: Compromise on cage ban or compromise on import rules. Could more fully analyse the reasoning for each option and add suggestions that lead to a solution, such as accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages in exchange for increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).

Provide a conclusion that summarizes your recommendations as well as briefly explaining why this is the best course of action. 

Provide a fall-back option if there is one available.

Summary:
The trainee's answer provides a brief overview of the main issues and recommendations for the animal welfare legislative proposal. However, there are several areas where the answer could be improved in terms of clarity, organization, and style.

Clarity:
The trainee's answer lacks clarity in some parts. The trainee mentions four policy measures without providing specific details about each measure. It would be helpful to provide more information about each measure and its impact on animal welfare. Additionally, the trainee mentions the need for harmonized EU rules but does not explain why this is important or how it relates to the main issues.

Organization:
The trainee's answer lacks a clear structure or logical flow.

It would be beneficial to organize the information into separate sections or paragraphs to improve readability.

Style:
The trainee's writing style is generally clear and concise, but there are some areas where improvement is needed. The trainee uses abbreviations without providing any explanation or clarification, which may confuse the reader. Additionally, the trainee could benefit from providing more specific examples or evidence to support their recommendations and arguments.

This would enhance the clarity of the answer and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the main issues.

Secondly, the trainee should consider organizing the information into separate sections or paragraphs with clear headings or subheadings. This would improve the overall structure and logical flow of the answer, making it easier for the reader to follow the trainee's argument.

Lastly, the trainee should provide more specific examples or evidence to support their recommendations and arguments. This would strengthen the trainee's position and provide a more persuasive case for their proposed course of action.

Observations
The central argument, which is the draft revised animal welfare regulation, is communicated clearly.

The central messageâ€”that the European Commission is proposing legislation to phase out animal cages to improve animal welfareâ€”is quite effectively communicated.

The flow of the communication is logical, starting with an introduction, followed by the main argument and challenges, and concluding with the Commissionâ€™s goals.

The layout is clear but lacks visual elements that could make it more engaging.

The titles and subtitles are present, but they could be made more specific for better clarity.

The tone is formal and appropriate for a briefing note.

The language is mostly clear, but it could be more concise, especially in the ""Main argument"" section.

There is no noticeable bias in the communication.

The document has a clearly titled ""Introduction"" section.
There is no clearly titled ""Recommendations"" section.
The document includes a ""Conclusion"" section, but this could be expanded.

More content is needed to better explore the topic.

Supporting statistics are not present in the text, which would have greatly strengthened the argument.

The text specifically mentions the European Union but does not list individual EU member states.

Non-EU countries are not mentioned in the text.
