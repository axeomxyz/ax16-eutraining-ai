“In December 20XX-2, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on batteries and waste batteries.”

Could have had more clarity in expressing the purpose of the memo. 
E.g.:
“The purpose of this memo is to launch the interservice consultation procedure for the new Regulation on Batteries and waste batteries. It is intended to structure the review of the original proposal, considering the observations of the Council and the European Parliament, and to further materialize the specific requirements by setting measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based targets and objectives.”

The further sections of the memo omit several key issues and data concerning the topic. 

It could also have been structured in a clearer and more coherent way. The information thus seems disjointed and impacts the flow and readability of the document. For a manager with limited understanding of this area, it would be difficult to gain a complete picture of the topic and the interconnectivity of the issues. 

The Agenda section is far too concise. It could still use subheadings and bullet points but also should expand on the key points. 
E.g.: 
1. General points
The new regulation should apply to all batteries including all waste portable batteries, electric vehicle batteries, industrial batteries, starting, lightning and ignition batteries, and batteries for light means of transport (e.g., electric bikes, e-mopeds, e-scooters).
2. Supply chain of raw materials
3. Production of batteries in the EU
4. Functioning of the internal market

Overall, the memo leaves the impression of being a work-in-progress. 

Additionally, the topic of batteries is not related to the Green Deal and possible consequences.

Observations
The document is structured very well into clear sections where relevant information can be found.

The first section shows promise in its ability to effectively summarize the context. But the several grammatical errors impact its readability. 

The blueprint section does not include enough key information on U-Space, nor does it explain what U-Space is. 
E.g.:
”U-space is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for large numbers of drones. 

These services rely on a high level of digitalisation and automation of functions, whether they are on board the drone itself or part of the ground-based environment. 

U-space provides an enabling framework to support routine drone operations, as well as a clear and effective interface to manned aviation.”

This section is far too brief and lacks sufficient detail, especially considering the prime objective of the press release. Additionally, the written style here is disjointed, making it difficult to understand. A better, more detailed way to convey this information:
E.g.:

“The delivery of U-space relies upon the following key principles:
•	To ensure the safety of all airspace users operating in the U-space framework, as well as people on the ground.
•	To provide a scalable, flexible and adaptable system that can respond to changes in demand, volume, technology, business models and applications, while managing the interface with manned aviation.
•	To enable high-density operations with multiple automated drones under the supervision of fleet operators.
•	To guarantee equitable and fair access to airspace for all users.
•	To enable competitive and cost-effective service provision at all times, supporting the business models of drone operators.
•	To minimise deployment and operating costs by leveraging as much of the existing aeronautical services and infrastructure as possible, including GNSS as well as those from other sectors, such as mobile communication services.
•	To accelerate deployment by adopting technologies and standards from other sectors where they meet the needs of U-space.
•	To follow a risk-based and performance-driven approach when setting up appropriate requirements for safety, security and resilience, while minimising environmental impact and respecting the privacy of citizens, including data protection.”

The opportunities and threats section illustrates a pleasing and much stronger written style. Areas of opposition are highlighted effectively and there is evidence of solid reasoning.

Would have been useful to pinpoint data here from Gartner regarding the 3 million drones that are expected to be shipped and that should translate into revenues of $6 billion. 
Conversely, the section entitled Next Steps includes far too much detail that again impacts the coherence. The pertinent information should been summarized more succinctly. The written style should reflect that this is a press release and that the intended audience is the general public. For this reason, there should be an emphasis on ease of readability. 

E.g.:
“The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules that are proportionate to the risk of the operation. 
These rules will implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which the European Parliament and the Council (i.e. the EU Member States) are expected to adopt in the coming months.

The Commission, through the SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system.”

A conclusion should be included to summarize the main points of the press release.

A lot of potential is shown here in being able to focus on the relevant information and structure it clearly. 
But the writing style is more suited to a written briefing than a speech. Furthermore, the writing style could overall be elevated in fluency and tone. There are also several grammar and spelling mistakes throughout the document. 
Would benefit from having an introduction and conclusion.
Considering this is a briefing for a press conference, an introduction should be included that better captures the attention of the audience in a couple of impactful, punchy sentences and that quickly summarizes what the speech will touch on. 
E.g. Alluding to the introduction of ChatGPT and DALL.E: these are recognizable names that generative AI is known as in the public sphere. 
Something general should be included in the introduction about the consequences regarding the future of work, for society, politics and democracy. And that the goal is to stop disinformation by way of a clear labelling system.
Overall, the clarity of the message is at times diluted by too much detail of issues that are not strictly relevant e.g., mentioning the impact on the workforce is not the main issue of this particular briefing. At other times clarity suffers due to not having enough detail. 
More practice is needed in creating succinct yet clear arguments with just the right level of detail depending on the given task.
A brief conclusion should have also been included.

The central theme of Generative AI and its implications are reasonably communicated, but there's room for some improvement in terms of clarity and detail.

The central message that discusses the benefits and dangers of Generative AI, as well as the EU’s stance, is evident but could be made more impactful with cleaner writing.

The content has a logical flow, beginning with an introduction, proceeding to discuss the pros and cons of GAI, and concluding with the EU's stance.

While the layout is mostly clear, it could benefit from improved formatting, such as consistent bullet-point styles and better subheadings.

The tone is formal and appropriate for a speech by a Commissioner.

Although the language is generally straightforward, there are instances where it could be simplified for greater clarity.

There doesn't appear to be any bias; the document attempts to present a balanced view of GAI.

The document contains a clearly titled 'Introduction' section.
There is no clearly titled 'Recommendations' section.
There is a clearly titled 'Conclusion' section.

There are no supporting statistics provided in the text to strengthen the arguments. These would be expected to be included in a Commissioner's speech.

The text specifically mentions the European Union but does not list individual EU member states.

The text does not contain information on Non-EU countries. (A commissioner would put the subject into an international context especially something as strategically important as AI)

Spelling mistakes:
""Al"" should be ""AI""
""tom"" should be ""to""
""Econmic"" should be ""Economic""
""imperonate"" should be ""impersonate""
""reponsibilities"" should be ""responsibilities""
""AI lebels"" should be ""AI labels""

Grammar Mistakes:
""it´s our collective responsibility"" should be ""it's our collective responsibility""
""Today I would like to talk about a topic that´s both"" should be ""Today, I would like to talk about a topic that's both""
""it´s crucial that we, as the European Commission, are proactive"" should be ""it's crucial that we, as the European Commission, are proactive""

The structure of the note is clear, with an introduction, sections on understanding GAI, the dangers associated with it, the EU's stance, and how the EU plans to address the challenges. The language used is generally clear and concise, and the trainee effectively communicates the key message of the note. However, there are some areas for improvement in terms of grammar, sentence structure, and clarity.

The strong points of your text were the following:
- Clear structure with separate sections addressing different aspects of the topic.
- Good overview of the potential benefits and dangers of GAI.
- Effective communication of the key message of the note.

Where I suggest improvement is:
- Grammar: There are some grammatical errors throughout the text that need to be corrected. For example, ""Generative Al"" should be ""Generative AI"" and ""tom"" should be ""to"" in the sentence ""GAI can be used tom tailor content to individual needs.""
- Sentence structure: Some sentences are too long and complex, making them difficult to understand. It would be better to break them down into shorter, more concise sentences.
- Clarity: There are some areas where the language could be simplified for better understanding. For example, instead of saying ""GAI can stimulate creativity by producing unique content, aiding fields like art music, and literature,"" it would be clearer to say ""GAI can stimulate creativity in fields such as art, music, and literature by producing unique content.""
- Transition between ideas: Some paragraphs could benefit from better transition between ideas to improve the flow of the text. For example, the transition between the section on the dangers of GAI and the EU's stance could be smoother.

The quality, relevance, and conciseness of your arguments were generally good, but there are some areas where the trainee could provide more specific examples or evidence to support their points. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide more context and background information on GAI and its current use or development.

Overall, the trainee has provided a solid speaking note on Generative AI (GAI), addressing the potential benefits and dangers of GAI and the EU's approach to addressing them. With some improvements in grammar, sentence structure, and clarity, the note could be even more effective in communicating the key message to the audience.

Observations
The candidate clearly has a very high level of writing capability. The most relevant information has been summarized and convincing arguments with solid reasoning are employed. 

However, the style and tone is more suited to a written briefing than a speech.  

Although it is a speech, it is still advisable to clearly mark sections on the document for the speaker: e.g., introduction; what is generative AI; the dangers of generative AI; legal framework on AI; new rules for generative AI; conclusion.

Considering this is a press conference, consider an introduction that would better capture the attention of the audience in a couple of impactful, punchy sentences and quickly summarize what the speech will touch on. 

For example, could have alluded to ChatGPT and DALL.E, recognizable names that generative AI is known as in the public sphere. 

Again, considering this is a speech, include something that would immediately connect with the emotion of the audience. For example, people are fearful of losing their jobs in the not-to-distant future.

Use the introduction to also communicate the consequences this technology could have regarding the future of work, for society, politics and democracy. And that the goal is to stop disinformation by way of a clear labelling system. 

The body of the document is written clearly and fluently with a very pleasing style. 

Could have mentioned that generative AI produces text that appears authentic and human-like.

Regarding the legal framework: Perhaps mention what the obligations entail re tools that receive a high-risk classification. They will not be banned, but those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations. 

Some grammar issues – allow enough time to proof-read the work. 

Unfortunate that the candidate was unable to finish the speech in the time available.  A brief conclusion was omitted as a result. 

Although most key issues were covered, these points were not, most probably due to lack of time. 

-  a clear labelling system for services with potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation.
- services that integrate generative AI such as Bingchat for Microsoft and Bard for Google should include safeguards so that they cannot be used by malicious actors. 
- the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act.
- obligations on labelling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament and the Commission.

Observations
Generally, this is a very good attempt to present a complex issue.
The introductory paragraph conveys relevant background information regarding the topic. However, the written style needs work in terms of professional fluency, and there are grammar issues that need to be ironed out. 

Also, I’m not entirely clear on the focus of the briefing from this introduction, as the disagreement of DG AGRI should be flagged from the outset. 

In the policy objective section, the key issues are set out clearly in bullet points.  However, from I. Main Issues, the briefing gives the impression of being a work-in-progress, due to its overreliance on writing in note form. Because of this, the text seems slightly disjointed and there is a lack of coherence at times. 
Furthermore, some points are not elaborated on further, analysed for their significance, or more completely argued. 
Some key details and relevant information is omitted or generalized. Providing more specifics and data on key issues will give a more comprehensive overview of the situation and lead to more informed reasoning regarding the solutions going forward. 
E.g.:
-  Could have mentioned that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- The timing for bans were subject to being based on low, medium or high ambition options for each measure, so briefly mention what these options mean.

The suggestions given are commendable, but these need to be clearer, with recommendations given with solid reasoning as well as an exploration of consequences.

Some further grammar issues and several typos impact the readability of the document.

Although written in a pleasing style, the briefing document would have benefitted from a clearer structure. 
E.g., introduction & background/ main issues /options for the way forward & recommendations/ conclusion. 

The candidate has successfully identified the main areas of concern and offered some recommendations. But some of the information towards the end of the document would have worked better in the introduction/background section where it could have provided better context.

The issue with DG AGRI should have been flagged immediately and expanded upon.

The candidate has made an effort to explain the low, medium and high ambition options that the legislative proposal is based on, as well as the main issues involved. Perhaps these issues could have been listed in a clearer way. 
E.g.:
The legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: 
1.	restricting the use of cages/crates;
2.	ending the killing of day-old male chickens;
3.	banning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and
4.	setting animal welfare requirements at import.

Overall, the main issues section needs to be expanded to detail the support from other DGs, as well as the concern and viewpoints of DG AGRI and DG SANTE.

The candidate has done a good job in summarizing some key issues in relation to space requirement concerns and that farmers would need to be compensated. The risk of unfair competition from third countries is mentioned but not fully explored.

Would also have been useful to touch on the following points:

E.g.:
- Perhaps mention that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- Also, could expand by explaining that it is not the main issue for small farmers, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. 
- Additionally, that for several member states, the cage ban will make no difference as they have already adopted the ban with national legislation. The cage ban therefore helps create a more level playing field. 

In the recommendations section, there are some good suggestions made. But overall, there is a tendency to veer towards being too concise, to the detriment of the briefing. Fully expand on the reasoning behind taking different options.

Could have also included more concrete options for the way forward in reaching an agreement with DG AGRI. 

E.g.: Compromise on cage ban or compromise on import rules. Could more fully analyse the reasoning for each option and add suggestions that lead to a solution, such as accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages in exchange for increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).

Provide a conclusion that summarizes your recommendations as well as briefly explaining why this is the best course of action. 

Provide a fall-back option if there is one available.

Observations

The candidate has identified the main areas of concern and has done a commendable job in structuring the information clearly.
 
I would have preferred to see a more detailed introduction and background section, as well as a section that dealt with the main issues. This could have immediately flagged the problem with DG AGRI and clearly listed the main issues that the legislative proposal includes.
E.g.,
The legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: 
1.	restricting the use of cages/crates;
2.	ending the killing of day-old male chickens;
3.	banning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and
4.	setting animal welfare requirements at import.

In the policy recommendations section, some more detailed information could have been useful. 

E.g., The timing for bans were subject to being based on low, medium or high ambition options for each measure, so perhaps briefly mentioning these would aid the reader in grasping the issue more fully. It would also enable you to refer to these later on when weighing which option could lead to DG AGRI’s positive response.

Although there is concrete data to back up the arguments against the recommended policies, there is a lack of hard numbers for the arguments in favour. This makes it difficult to convey why the policies should be followed. 
E.g.:
- Perhaps mention that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- Also, could expand by explaining that it is not the main issue for small farmers, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. 
- Additionally, that for several member states, the cage ban will make no difference as they have already adopted the ban with national legislation. The cage ban therefore helps create a more level playing field. 

Could have also included more concrete options for the way forward in reaching an agreement with DG AGRI.

E.g.: Compromise on cage ban or compromise on import rules. Could more fully analyse the reasoning for each option and add suggestions that lead to a solution, such as accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages in exchange for increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).

Overall, there is a tendency to veer towards being too concise, to the detriment of strengthening the arguments and proposals.

There are some grammatical issues that slightly impact the readability of the document.
