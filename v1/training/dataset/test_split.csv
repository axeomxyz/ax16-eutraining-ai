Dear [your name],
Welcome to your first day in the unit! You will have to hit the ground running - we have received an urgent request for a briefing. Our Director-General, Ms Heinrich, needs a summary of state of play concerning the draft revised animal welfare regulation, for her decision on the way forward.
As you have seen in the draft regulation text, we have followed the “preferred options” identified in our thorough impact assessment (those marked green in the impact assessment options table). This draft legislative proposal is what we as DG SANTE believe best serves our policy objectives and this is what we need to defend as far as possible. We received strong support for an ambition line in all the stakeholder consultations.
In the recent inter-service consultation, we also received green light (positive opinion) by all DGs except one. DG AGRI has unfortunately not been able to accept our draft legislative proposal. This means we will either need to make small compromise adjustments to the original proposal and change our preferred option, or we try to somehow convince DG AGRI to accept our main line.
In your briefing, please outline the main issues at hand and explain the options for next step so that our Director-General can make an informed decision on it. She did invite us to already make a recommendation based on our knowledge of the file if we have a preference.
You should keep the briefing short and concise, no more than two pages.
I have placed a file with various materials on your desk. It should contain what you need for the draft briefing. Please have a first version done already today at X o’clock so I can check it before passing it on to Ms Heinrich.
Thank","you and best of luck,
Wiebke

Attachment 5: Press statement

Brussels, April 202X-2
Every year across the European Union, around three hundred million farmed animals are confined in cages. Unable to conduct many of their natural behaviours, these animals are treated as nothing more than production machines. No single EU Member State is completely cage free and in some Member States up to 90% of all hens, mother pigs and young calves are kept in cages and crates. This despite farming industry having had more than 15 years to voluntarily change their installations.
Over 170 organisations and caring citizens across Europe therefore joined forces to spearhead the “End the Cage Age” European citizens’ initiative. In total, 1.4 million EU citizens made their voices heard and signed the petition. Only one other citizen’s initiative has so far gathered more signatures than this.
Mr Daniel Müller, campaign leader for “End the Cage Age” said: what we see now is the battle of ethics versus economy. EU citizens do not want cheap food at any cost and certainly not at the cost of pain and suffering of our fellow creatures. Food industry and economic interests will have to adapt to this reality – and finally do what is right.
In response to our tireless campaigning, in April 202X-2, the European Commission committed to proposing legislation before the end of 202X to phase out and finally prohibit the use of animal cages. We must now ensure that a total ban on caged farming is delivered, as soon as possible. The fight also continues to pave the way not only for a cage-free Europe, but for a cage-free world by making sure that all imported products in the EU comply with cage-free standards.


Attachment 6: Website

What is a citizens' initiative?
A European citizens’ initiative is a way for you and other Europeans to take an active part in EU policymaking.
If you want the EU to act on a particular issue, you can launch a citizens’ initiative calling on the European Commission to propose new EU legislation on that issue.
For an initiative to be considered by the Commission, you need to get one million citizens from across the EU to sign it in support.
Step 1: Get started
Before launching an initiative, it is worth considering some of the key practical aspects, including:
is asking for EU legislation to be passed the best way to achieve your goals?
you must first set up a group of organisers composed of at least 7 EU citizens living in seven different EU countries. To do so, you need to find people to team up with across Europe who are willing to support your issue.
how will you organise your campaign to collect the signatures?
You can find detailed advice on all these issues on the European Citizens’ Initiative Forum




Step 2: Get your initiative registered
Before you can start collecting signatures for your initiative, you must ask the Commission to register it.
For this, you will need to:
create an organiser account. You will use this to manage your initiative and liaise with the Commission throughout its lifecycle.
provide a description of your initiative in one of the official EU languages (as well as details and relevant documents on the group of organisers, funding received, etc.)
The Commission is not obliged to register all initiatives. It only registers initiatives that meet certain criteria.
Once you ask for your initiative to be registered, we will assess whether to accept it.
You will receive an answer within 2-4 months.


Step 3: Get support
You need to get the support of at least one million people, with minimum numbers in at least seven EU countries. They must fill in a specific statement of support form.
You can collect:
on paper (pre-filled forms, downloadable from your organiser account) or
online (using the Central Online Collection System).
These forms are available in all EU official languages.
To sign, people must be:
EU nationals (nationals of an EU country)
old enough to vote in European elections or aged at least 16 in some countries
TIP – It is better to collect more signatures than you need. Sometimes the authorities in each country might not be able to validate all the statements of support you provide. Throughout the collection procedure, you must comply with data protection rules.


Step 4: Submit your initiative
Once you have received the last certificate from the national authorities, you have 3 months to submit your initiative to the Commission – together with the information on the support and funding you have received for the initiative.


What next?
If the Commission considers legislation an appropriate response to your initiative, it will start preparing a formal proposal. This can require preparatory steps like public consultations, impact assessments, etc. Once adopted by the Commission, the proposal is submitted to the European Parliament and the EU Council (or in some cases, only to the Council), which will need to adopt it for it to become law.
The Commission is not obliged to propose legislation. Even where it responds positively, the most appropriate follow-up to an initiative may be non-legislative in nature. There are a range of other measures that may be more suitable.
The European Parliament may also assess the measures taken by the Commission.

Dear Wiebke,
Just a heads-up about the AGRI response to your animal welfare ISC - you will receive it later today. We can accept all of it, but we have a remaining concern about the proposed new rules for poultry cage rearing.
First, the proposed exception for farms less than 50 livestock units (3500 laying hens) does not make much sense. The overwhelming majority of eggs produced in the EU come from farms with more than 5000 birds (70 livestock units) and the smaller farms can anyway more easily transition to cage-free rearing if they haven’t done so already.
Longer transition time also does not help, it’s not about more time for farms to adapt. It’s about the money and about food prices.
For large-scale installations, cages are simply more efficient and use much less space. With your proposal, notably the requirement of more space per laying hen, production will necessarily be less cost-efficient, and most farms will not be able to keep the same number of birds. Consumers might say they care about animal welfare but when they make their choices in the supermarket, the thing that matters most is the price! If you implement the new rules, the price of eggs might increase by around 20-40% in countries like Spain, Portugal, and Malta where cage systems are still the norm. This means we will see a significant increase in cheap imported eggs from third countries with much worse animal welfare standards. Our European farmers cannot compete on such unfair terms.
There is also the socioeconomic element: the burden of higher food prices will be heavier on the poorest families.
Unless farmers can be compensated economically somehow for taking this risk, we don’t see any need for changing the current rules on poultry caging and we will need to block your proposal.

Call me if you want to discuss this further.

Best,
Michael


Attachment 8: Press release


MEPs endorse EU citizens’ call for gradual end to caged farming
Press releases – AGRI - 20 February 202X-2

The European Parliament has called for the end of caged farming within the next 5 years. The parliament members voted on an own initiative resolution recommending a total ban on the use of cages in animal agriculture by 202X+3.
The vote followed intensive lobbying by the “End the Cage Age” European Citizens Initiative, led by 170 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) across Europe, which garnered 1.4m signatures from EU citizens and demanded the phasing out of cages on farms. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted by 558 to 37 with 85 abstentions on the non-binding resolution.
Unlevel playing field in Europe
Even though the EU has banned the use of battery cages in poultry production and sow stalls during gestation, campaigners said this was not enough, given the perceived unlevel playing field across Europe with some nations already going beyond EU laws.
According to the initiative, five out of 28 countries are currently achieving more than 80% cage-free production, i.e., Austria (97%), Luxembourg (97%), Sweden (92%), Germany (86%) and the Netherlands (82%). Bottom of the list is Malta, with 1%, followed by Spain and Portugal. About sows, the report is based on Eurostat figures, according to the initiative’s website.
In the European Parliament, a working group on cage-free farming established in 202X-10 has been actively supporting the “End the Cage Age” initiative and in October 202X-3, 101 MEPs from various political parties signed a letter of support addressed to EU Commissioners.
Speeding up the review of animal welfare legislation
Last month, the parliament’s AGRI committee adopted a motion for a resolution. Committee members called on the European Commission to speed up the review of the animal welfare legislation and back the phasing out of all cages in farming, possibly already by 202X+3. They also insisted on ensuring compliance with EU standards for all products imported into the EU.
By April this year, the European Commission will have made its decision as to whether to start a legislative process to ban caged farming. EU Food Safety commissioner Stella Kyriakides told MEPs that the Commission was considering a request contained within the resolution to apply the same animal welfare standards to meat imported from outside the EU as European farmers must meet inside the bloc.
Kyriakides also noted the call for farmers to receive compensation and support in their transition from cages. She added the phase-out would happen “as soon as feasible” but did not give a specific date.
The results for pork production could be far-reaching, as it would likely change the current practice using farrowing crates. In recent years, a lot of research initiatives have already been launched to design free farrowing concepts.

Subject: Cages and antibiotics

Dear Ms Munoz,
Congratulations on your concluded impact assessment on the animal welfare regulation!
In view of your upcoming drafting process, I need to point out that there are several scientific studies pointing to higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, notably among e-coli bacteria, in non-cage housing systems for poultry - if not implemented correctly and with strict quality standards. I feel this did not come out clearly enough from your impact assessment.
Free-range egg production systems face more challenges related to biosecurity and use of antibiotics. The free-range layer birds have more interaction with each other compared to caged ones, leading to an increased incidence of infectious poultry diseases requiring treatment with antimicrobials, in turn leading to increased emergence of resistant commensal and pathogenic bacteria. This is a major threat to public health.
The main factor to consider is of course, as always, the number of hens per square meter, the hygiene routines, and the overall rules on veterinary prescription of antibiotics. It is the same for pigs: sows in small crates have low life quality but use less medication; pigs in free range but packed close together require lots of antibiotics and pigs in free range with sufficient space are more healthy and less prone to cause antimicrobial resistance. However, they are also much less cost-effective for industrial-size farming. 
Still, to ensure safe food production and avoid antibiotics resistance, livestock density simply must go down. 
If you could take these concerns into account in your draft revised regulation, we would be much grateful.

Best regards,
Ana Calbi

Attachment 10: Impact assessment

COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT

IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT


Animal welfare: revised regulation


Executive summary
To address the specific objectives of the animal welfare legislation revision, four policy measures have been considered, with low, medium, and high ambition options. Impacts assessed include cost-efficiency, environmental and societal impacts and impacts on the single market. The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) has confirmed the scientific evidence. Numerous stakeholder consultations and supporting studies have been performed.
For animals kept for economic purposes, the measures/options covered are:
1) 	Phasing out confining cages/crates for the following species and categories of animals:
Pigs
Calves
Laying hens and pullets
Rabbits and fur-producing animals.
A general transition period of between five and twelve years would be considered, depending on the level of ambition. Exceptions e.g., depending on farm size (number of “livestock units” where 1 livestock unit = 1 cow, or 2 pigs, or 71 laying hens) could be considered.
2) 	Banning the killing of day-old male chicks (or, as an alternative option, introducing an obligation of marking eggs from production systems where day-old chicks are killed). In the case of a ban, while a transition period of five years would be technically sufficient, notably if combined with stricter import rules, the impacts could be mitigated by introducing a ten years’ transition period.

3) 	Banning painful mutilations, i.e., beak trimming in poultry and tail docking in pigs (with incentives instead of bans as alternative options). For the bans, a general transition period of ten years has been considered. Incentives for voluntary action would enter into force immediately.
  
4) 	Animal welfare requirements at import. For animals and products of animal origin imported to the EU, either similar or fully equivalent animal welfare requirements with the revised EU animal welfare requirements for kept animals, as regards the use of cages, mutilations, space allowances, enrichment, the killing of day-old chicks and the welfare of fur animals would apply. A transition period of five-ten years has been considered.

A phase-out of the use of cages and stalls would considerably improve the welfare of more than 160 million laying hens, 53 million pullets (young hens), 13 million sows, two million calves, 35 million ducks and geese and 100 million rabbits. They would be able to perform a more natural and healthy behaviour.
A partial or total ban on cages and crates would have an important economic impact on the sectors concerned. For instance, for laying hens we have estimated the required investments for a transition into a cage-free system to about EUR 2,4-2,8 billion. For sows, the cost of demolishing the current system with gestation and farrowing crates could amount to around EUR 64-100 /m². These costs are likely to result in higher consumer prices. 
The situation however differs between Member States. Some have already taken measures to phase out cages and stalls whereas others have not. 
To mitigate these economic impacts, certain measures could be considered, notably awareness-raising vis-à-vis consumers, economic incentives via the Common Agricultural Policy and import rules to ensure a level playing field / reduce unfair competition.
The proposed measures would ensure a positive impact on sustainability as it would imply less intensive food production, causing less pollution to air and water. However, since cage-free animals move around more, they spend more energy and consume more feed. This could have a negative impact on the use of resources.

Background
Since 202X-10, EU legislation requires that laying hens be kept either in enriched cages, or alternative systems (single or multi-tier barn or, free-range). The current legislation allows calves being individually housed until the age of eight weeks, while sows and gilts are kept in confinement for a period of four weeks after service and from one week before the expected time of farrowing to weaning of their piglets. 
Approximately one million farms keep laying hens in the EU. Forty-five percent of these are kept in enriched cages. 
There is currently a trend towards using less cages in many EU Member States such as France, the Netherlands and Poland to answer to consumer’s expectations. E.g., Austria and Luxembourg have already banned the use of cages for laying hens. The animal welfare problems related to cages will however remain for many laying hens if no action is taken at EU level.

Problem drivers
Conventional livestock production systems across EU countries are put under pressure by competitive global markets, a rise in input costs and the search for maximum profit margins by farmers and all food business operators along the production chain. The demand of certain consumers’ segments for low price food is expected to be more prevalent in the current inflationary context.
This pressure over production costs has led to further intensification (and specialisation) of the farming and killing practices, as business operators increase the volume of production to reduce overheads costs per livestock unit. Evidence shows that, while the number of livestock farms is decreasing, their size is increasing. Small farms are replaced by very large industrial scale installations.
This trend has led to certain detrimental effects on animal welfare due to high densities, certain management practices, housing/transport conditions and stunning methods, as well as due to certain breeding strategies.
Current EU rules also do not consider new scientific evidence and huge technological developments in relation to agricultural practices, zootechnics and transport operations. For instance, this new scientific evidence relates to a new understanding of stocking densities, behaviour (need for an enriched environment), mutilation practices, journey times and space allowances for animal transports, and stunning methods used for pigs, poultry, and farmed fish.
The lack of update of the EU animal welfare legislation has led Member States to adopt an increasing number of national measures going beyond EU minimum requirements to respond to the growing citizens’ concerns towards animal welfare, leading to a fragmented legal landscape, including as regards animal welfare labelling.
At the same time, consumers are growing more aware and more demanding. The upward trend of societal demands for better animal welfare protection is not reflected in the current legislative requirements. 

Figure 1: Problem tree 

Economic and environmental impacts of the preferred package of options: cages for laying hens
The policy option assessed to be most cost-efficient is a total prohibition on the use of cages for laying hens with a transition period of 5 years (from the date of entry into force of the revised legislation).
However, if no similar requirements apply for eggs and egg products imported into the EU from third countries, since the EU consumers’ demand for eggs is not expected to decrease and since EU production is expected to decrease, an increase in eggs obtained from caged hens imported from non-EU countries with lower standards is expected, thus limiting the positive animal welfare impact of the measure.
The required investments for a transition into a cage-free system for laying hens would amount to around EUR 2,4-2,8 billion.
A prohibition of cages would decrease the number of laying hens by an estimated 30% (i.e., from 186,8 million to 102,9 million) in farms which currently have cage systems.

SME’s
Small farms tend to use cage-free systems more than big farms. A prohibition would therefore primarily have a positive competitiveness impact on small farms.

Public authorities
It is likely that a prohibition would generate additional enforcement costs in the short term for the national competent authorities, however these will come back to current levels in the medium term.

Consumers
A prohibition would lead to an expected increase in the price of eggs, but to which extent is not clear. Some estimates by the EU poultry industry suggest a + 20% price gap between eggs from cages and those from barn systems. However, sales data from the Netherlands and Germany suggests a much smaller difference in prices: less than one eurocent per egg.
With an average per capita consumption of 210 eggs per year, or 4,04 eggs per week, this would mean that transitioning to cage-free systems would add less than four eurocents per person to consumers’ weekly food shopping bill. Furthermore, the experience from Germany, where enriched cages are progressively phased out, even suggests that the price for barn eggs may eventually be the same as for eggs from enriched cages.
 
Environmental impacts
A prohibition would have a positive impact on sustainability as it would imply less intensive production leading to less air and water pollution and less greenhouse gas emissions.

| A gestation crate, also known as a sow stall, is a metal enclosure in which a   used for breeding may be kept during pregnancy. A standard crate measures 2 m x 60 cm. | Sow stalls contain no bedding material and are instead floored with slatted plastic, concrete, or metal to allow waste to be efficiently collected below. This waste is then flushed into open-air pits known as . A few days before giving birth (farrowing), sows are moved to farrowing crates where they are able to lie down, with an attached crate from which their piglets can nurse. | Most pregnant sows in the US are kept in gestation crates. The crates are banned for new installations in Austria and Canada, but many sows are still confined there in pig breeding facilities. The crates are banned in the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, and Sweden. However, farrowing crates, in which female breeding pigs can be kept for up to five weeks, are not banned in the UK. | Opponents of the crates argue that they constitute animal abuse, while proponents say they are needed to prevent sows from fighting among themselves. |

Health and food safety Commissioner will fight for ethical food systems in Europe
30 October 202X-3
Earlier today, Commissioner Kyriakides met with the representatives of the citizens’ initiative ‘End the Cage Age’. EURACTIV interviewed the Commissioner after her meeting with the campaign team.
Stella Kyriakides is European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety and in charge of the EU animal welfare legislation. She spoke to EURACTIV about the call for revised animal welfare legislation and the possibility for action ahead.
This is one of the most strongly supported citizens’ initiatives so far with almost 1.4 million signatures collected. How will the Commission respond to all who signed this petition?
I am impressed by the hard work by these dedicated young people. I promised them today that the Commission will investigate this very carefully.
In fact, we recently completed a review of our legislation and have found that there is indeed scope for improvement. However, first we will hear the views of the European Parliament and we will consult across the Commission services and then reply about next steps.
Your colleague, the Commissioner for Agriculture, is less enthusiastic. How will you get the farming community onboard?
As always, there will be a balancing act between several interests. Farmers produce the food we eat and they deserve to be heard as well. Many farmers also already made this transition, showing it is possible to rear animals cage-free.
The Commission always performs a thorough impact assessment, so any legislative proposal will be based on solid facts and on careful consideration of all relevant impacts. We always seek a sustainable compromise.
There could also be other possibilities to make animal welfare more attractive for farmers by e.g., economic incentives, subsidies, trade schemes and awareness campaigns. It is not just about laws and penalties.
On the other hand, I think the farming industry has known for a long time that this is coming, they have had plenty of time to prepare and many Member States have in fact already taken significant steps in the direction of free-range animal rearing.
But is there not a risk that ‘money will talk’, how can you weigh the economic impacts against animal suffering – how will the comparison be done in an impact assessment?
No, economic interests are not the only interests we take into account. It is true that our assessment is expressed as a cost-benefit ratio, but among those ‘benefits’, we consider also softer values such as social, health and environmental impacts – and ethical choices. I guarantee you that industry interests will not dominate this process. 
On the contrary, I think what we see here is a strong message from European citizens that animal rights and animal welfare must be respected, and I agree with them. We cannot ignore this question any longer.",25,5.0,"Summary

Although written in a pleasing style, the briefing document would have benefitted from a clearer structure. 
E.g., introduction & background/ main issues /options for the way forward & recommendations/ conclusion. 

The candidate has successfully identified the main areas of concern and offered some recommendations. But some of the information towards the end of the document would have worked better in the introduction/background section where it could have provided better context.

The issue with DG AGRI should have been flagged immediately and expanded upon.

The candidate has made an effort to explain the low, medium and high ambition options that the legislative proposal is based on, as well as the main issues involved. Perhaps these issues could have been listed in a clearer way. 
E.g.:
The legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: 
1.	restricting the use of cages/crates;
2.	ending the killing of day-old male chickens;
3.	banning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and
4.	setting animal welfare requirements at import.

Overall, the main issues section needs to be expanded to detail the support from other DGs, as well as the concern and viewpoints of DG AGRI and DG SANTE.

The candidate has done a good job in summarizing some key issues in relation to space requirement concerns and that farmers would need to be compensated. The risk of unfair competition from third countries is mentioned but not fully explored.

Would also have been useful to touch on the following points:

E.g.:
- Perhaps mention that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- Also, could expand by explaining that it is not the main issue for small farmers, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. 
- Additionally, that for several member states, the cage ban will make no difference as they have already adopted the ban with national legislation. The cage ban therefore helps create a more level playing field. 

In the recommendations section, there are some good suggestions made. But overall, there is a tendency to veer towards being too concise, to the detriment of the briefing. Fully expand on the reasoning behind taking different options.

Could have also included more concrete options for the way forward in reaching an agreement with DG AGRI. 

E.g.: Compromise on cage ban or compromise on import rules. Could more fully analyse the reasoning for each option and add suggestions that lead to a solution, such as accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages in exchange for increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).

Provide a conclusion that summarizes your recommendations as well as briefly explaining why this is the best course of action. 

Provide a fall-back option if there is one available.",,"Tips to Improve

Work on clarity of structure.

2 pages is acceptable, meaning you don’t have to be so concise on key issues. 

Provide enough detail by writing complete paragraphs to fully explain the reasoning behind recommendations. 

Ensure you leave time to proofread to avoid typos.","Trainee's Answer
Date: 1 June 202X
To: Ms Heinrich (Director General of DG SANTE)
Subject: Animal welfare legislative proposal 
Main issues at stake (remaining problems)
- To address the specific objective of the animal welfare legislation revision, we have 4 policy measures with different ambition options (low, medium, high): 1) Pigs 2) Calves 3) Laying hens and pullets 4) Rabbits and fur-producing animals. The general transition period: 5-12 years depending on the level of the ambition (please see the table attached)
- For the banning of i) the killing of day-old male chicks and ii) paintful mutilations we should consider a ten years' transition period. 
Reccommendations
- we need to make sure to have similar or fully equivalent animal welfare requirements for products of animal origin imported to the EU
- the pressure over production costs due to a competitive global market for the farmers and all food business operators led to further intensification of the killing practices, and to a replacement of small farms by very large industrial scale installations
- we need to consider technological developments in relation to agricultural practices, zootechnics and transport operations
- we ned to have harmonised EU rules in order to stop MSs to adopt different national measures that jeropardise the legal landscape also for animal welfare labelling.
- the policy option to be most cost-efficient is a total prohibition on the use of cages for laying hens with a transition period of 5 years. The same requirment should be applied for eggs and egg products imported to the EU form 3rd countries.
- as suggested by DG AGRI a compensation mechnism for farmers should be taken into consideratino to avoid the increase of the price for consumers.
- we should take into consideration also the recommendation of the EFSA concerning the livestock density that should be reduced: free range layer birds with more interactions with each other can lead to an increased incidence of infectious poultry disease
Backgorund information
- After an European citizen's initiative ""End the cage Age"" and an own initiative resolution of the EUropean Parliament recommending a total ban on the use of cages in animal agriculture, the Commission is revising the Animal welfare Regulation. 
- We launched an inter-service consultation on the review of the the animal welfare Regulation, we got green light by all DGs except DG AGRI."

The Benefits of Driverless Cars
(Excerpt from “The Driver in the Driverless Car - How our technology choices will create the future” by VIVEK WADHWA & ALEX SALKEVER)

Few people seem to fully grasp the profound improvement in our lives that driverless cars will bring. Their adoption will slash accident and fatality rates, saving millions of lives. As well, it will remove one-third to one-half of all vehicles from city streets. A large percentage of the cars on the streets of New York, San Francisco, and London at any one time are looking for parking; but self-driving cars don’t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers.  The Earth Institute at Columbia University projects a 75 per cent reduction in the cost of car ownership, because fewer shared vehicles will be necessary to provide the same service collectively that personally owned vehicles provide. During peak hours, those shared vehicles will be in use 90 per cent of the time. And, with no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient. 
Most important, car sharing will cost a fraction of what car ownership today costs. Owning a car for daily, personal transportation will seem impractical. Self-driving cars will also deliver incontrovertible social beneﬁts. With self-driving cars, the disabled will no longer struggle to ﬁnd transportation; they will have an on-demand personal driver. Several years ago Google’s self-driving car team contacted Steve Mahan, Executive Director of the Santa Clara Valley Blind Center. The team wanted feedback and let Mahan come along for test-drives in earlier self-driving Prius models as well as in the latest Google car. “My experience with Google has been terriﬁc, and I want it to happen,” Mahan told the Times. “Everyone in the blind community wants it to happen.” 
Other groups will also beneﬁt in tangible ways. Women and children will never worry about getting a cab ride late at night. Once all drivers are off the road, trafﬁc violations will no longer be an issue, and cops will have fewer reasons to pull over cars, which should reduce instances of the currently vicious discrimination against individuals “driving while black.” Teens will not face insurance discrimination as they do today, and their parents will not have to pay for the dubious privilege of teaching a teenager to drive. People living in the country will ﬁnally gain access to transportation services that put them nearly on par with their city cousins. Pedestrians will stop worrying about getting hit by cars in intersections.
Let me paint a picture of what streets will look like in an age of driverless cars. We will no longer need traffic lights: robot cars will synchronize wirelessly to time mass movements across city intersections and entries onto freeways or balletic dances around four-way stop signs. Having no human eyes behind the wheel will obviate much of the need for signalling and signage. When all the driverless cars are talking to each other, there will be no need for them to ever come to a complete halt and waste all their kinetic energy. So we will be able to forget traffic lights—and stop signs, yield signs, lighting on freeways, and dozens of other transportation-infrastructure elements catering to human drivers. This great elimination will save many, many billions of dollars in the United States. Equally important, self-driving cars will eliminate the need to build these types of infrastructure in less developed countries in which traffic lights, freeways, and other modern trafﬁc-control features have yet to be put in place. The future cost savings to those countries will be astronomical. In that future, the beneﬁts of self-driving cars will be far more evenly distributed.
Eliminating human drivers will also allow automobile designers to build cars from a completely different mind set. Driverless cars will not need steering columns, brake pedals, accelerator pedals or any of the other components drivers use for slowing or accelerating. They will not need a gearshift panel in the middle of the driver compartment or an emergency brake pedal. The A.I. system driving the car will also reduce accidents to negligible levels.

Robots and artificial intelligence: MEPs call for EU-wide liability rules 

Press Releases Plenary session 
16-02-20XX - 13:09  


As human-robot interactions become commonplace, MEPs stress that EU-wide rules are needed to guarantee a standard level of safety and security. © AP Images/European Union - EP

EU-wide rules are needed for the fast-evolving field of robotics, e.g. to enforce ethical standards or establish liability for accidents involving driverless cars, say MEPs in a resolution voted on Thursday. 
MEPs ask the EU Commission to propose rules on robotics and artificial intelligence, in order to fully exploit their economic potential and to guarantee a standard level of safety and security. They note that regulatory standards for robots are being planned in several countries, and point out that the EU needs to take the lead on setting these standards, so as not to be forced to follow those set by third countries.
Rapporteur Mady Delvaux (S&D, LU) said “Although I am pleased that the plenary adopted my report on robotics, I am also disappointed that the right-wing coalition of ALDE, EPP and ECR refused to take account of possible negative consequences on the job market. They rejected an open-minded and forward-looking debate and thus disregarded the concerns of our citizens.”
Liability rules and the impact of robots on the workforce
MEPs stress that draft legislation is urgently needed to clarify liability issues, especially for self-driving cars. They call for a mandatory insurance scheme and a supplementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driverless cars are fully compensated.
MEPs also ask the Commission to consider creating a specific legal status for robots in the long run, in order to establish who is liable if they cause damage.
The rapid development of robots might result in changes in the labour market through the creation, displacement and loss of certain jobs. MEPs urge the Commission to follow these trends closely.
A Code of Ethical Conduct and a new European Agency for robotics
The growing use of robotics also raises ethical issues, for example to do with privacy and safety, stress MEPs. They propose a voluntary ethical code of conduct on robotics for researchers and designers to ensure that they operate in accordance with legal and ethical standards and that robot design and use respect human dignity.
They also ask the Commission to consider creating a European agency for robotics and artificial intelligence, to supply public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise.
The resolution was passed by 396 votes to 123, with 85 abstentions. The Commission will not be obliged to follow the Parliament’s recommendations, but must state its reasons if it refuses.





PRESS RELEASE
10-03-20XX
Regulatory and legal framework for automated vehicles
Road traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. Different national jurisdictions can hinder the development and deployment of new technologies for systems or vehicles. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness.
Regulation of road traffic
The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968 (‘Vienna Convention of 1968') is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety by establishing standard traffic rules among the contracting parties. All EU Member States are signatories of the Vienna Convention — only the UK and Spain have not ratified it. 
One of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept, as laid down in Article 8, that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic.
The amended convention (20XX-1) still demands that every vehicle must have a driver. However, in the future it will be in accordance with the Convention that highly automated systems will have a driver who may take the hands off the wheel, but must be ready at all times to take over the driving functions, and who can override the system and switch it on and off. A further amendment process is therefore necessary to permit driverless vehicles. Systems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.
Technical requirements
Technical requirements for vehicles are internationally harmonised in the framework of the two following UNECE Agreements:
The 1958 Agreement provides the framework for establishing international UN Regulations with uniform performance—oriented test provisions and administrative procedures for granting type approvals, for the conformity of production and for the mutual recognition of the type approvals granted. The 1958 Agreement currently has 54 contracting parties and 135 annexed UN Regulations.
The 1998 Agreement concerns the establishing of global technical regulations for the construction of new vehicles, including performance requirements. Its purpose is to further enhance the process of international harmonisation through the development of global technical regulations (GTR). The 1998 Agreement has 35 Contracting Parties and 16 UN GTRs, established in the UN Global Registry (March 20XX-2).
The European Union is a contracting party to the 1958 and the 1998 Agreement. 
Under the European vehicle type approval system, manufacturers can obtain approval for a new vehicle type in one EU Member State if it meets the EU technical requirements. The manufacturer can then market it EU—wide with no need for further approval tests or checks in other Member States. The approval is granted by a national authority in charge of type approval. The completion of the type approval examination results in issuance of a Certificate of Conformity, which is a statement by the manufacturer that the vehicle conforms to the relevant legal requirements as stipulated by EU legislation.
The common legal framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers is provided by a Framework Directive. Within the EU, mass—produced cars may only be used on public roads if they are type—approved in compliance with the administrative procedures and technical requirements established by the Directive.
General regulatory environment
The regulatory environment relating to cyber security, data privacy, and liability issues is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles.
Today's connected vehicles are already equipped with extensive IT communication capabilities. In-vehicle networks for information and entertainment co-exist with automotive control networks. The different networks have different degrees of relevance for the safe functioning of the vehicle and for cyber security risks and data protection issues.
Automated vehicles are extended vehicles, meaning that they have external software and hardware extensions as some of their features. These extensions are developed, implemented and managed by the vehicle manufacturer. The connection between the in—vehicle system and the manufacturer's central server has to be secure, so that all data transfers are protected from unauthorised disclosure and manipulation.
Uncontrolled, unrestricted access to vehicle data in the on-board network by third parties directly and indirectly jeopardises the safety of the vehicle, occupants and other road users. Media report increasingly on cyber security problems related to cars, for instance covering the successful attempt of hacking into a vehicle and controlling its basic driving functions via the entertainment and navigation software.
The debate on data privacy regarding connected automated vehicles is evolving in parallel with the new technologies. In general, digital services will be available in vehicles, as they are anywhere else. The ‘connected car‘ has the capability to generate, store and transmit users‘ personal data, such as their route to work, time of driving, favourite music, appointments or favourite restaurants. These data have a significant potential for other uses. As third parties can access and use sensitive driver and driving data, legislation seems necessary to protect personal privacy of consumers in connected vehicles.
The new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regard to digital technologies, valid across the EU.
Liability issues
Traffic accidents have very large costs in economic terms, in particular regarding human lives or health, or regarding damage to an object. Liability law answers the question of who is responsible and who has to bear the costs of an accident.
In the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products (Council Directive 85/374/EEC). A producer is liable for any damage caused by a defect in his product; a product is defective when it does not provide the safety which the consumer is entitled to expect.
However, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved — the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States.
Most liability regimes in the EU use a concept of causality for determining and allocating liability. From a certain level of vehicle automation on, it might be difficult to establish the exact cause of an accident and to prove if it is due to a defect with the automated vehicle or the behaviour of the driver. The new possible causes created by automation might interfere with the very objective of liability regimes to apportion risks, therefore an adaptation of liability law to the new technologies and a European harmonisation of the regimes concerning the liability of owners and/or drivers of automated vehicles seem necessary.

 


EU Commission drives home merits of autonomous vehicles
By Dave Keating | EURACTIV.com 
 Apr 6, 20XX

Can driverless cars chauffeur people to a love of the EU? The European Commission is betting it can.
Christmas came early for automated driving enthusiasts this week. Convening a two-day summit in Brussels on the subject – the first of its kind – the European Commission promised a sack of goodies in the form of dedicated funding, regulatory changes, cross-border agreements and innovation stimulus.
Driverless trucks could be a reality on European motorways within two years, officials said. They would first operate in convoys where the first truck is driven by a human being but all the trucks following are driverless.
It’s the first step in a roadmap, to be published by the Commission as part of its transport strategy on 31 May, that could see driverless cars integrated with traffic by 20XX+10.
“Owning a non-autonomous car will soon be like owning a horse,” said Carlos Moedas, the EU commissioner for research, science and innovation, who spoke at the conference.
Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has identified driverless vehicles as an area where the EU can deliver tangible benefits to citizens. In his five-scenario white paper on the future of Europe, released last month ahead of the EU’s 60th anniversary summit in Rome, connected and autonomous driving (CAD) was used repeatedly as an example of something that cannot become a reality without the EU.
In a scenario in which the EU downgrades to only a free trade zone, “Europeans are reluctant to use connected cars due to the absence of EU-wide rules and technical standards,” the paper concluded.
Three weeks later, national leaders signed an agreement in Rome to not only allow cross-border tests and experiments but also to establish one single point of contact in each country to approve them.
Highway cruising
Trucks are expected to be the first to go driverless, both because they drive on motorways and because they are the most commercially interesting. Though convoys following a lead driven vehicle will be the first step, the next step will be completely independent automated trucks.
Motorways present the safest environment for CAD because they are free of pedestrians and are more or less in a straight line. They are also more uniform throughout Europe. In the very near future trucks will be driven within cities by a driver, but then dropped off at the motorway to continue its journey alone. When the truck arrives at its destination, a new driver would pick it up at the motorway exit.
“Lisbon to Warsaw today is four and a half days, but that could be brought down to one and a half,” José Manuel Viegas, secretary-general of the International Transport Forum at the OECD, told euractiv.com.
“It’s very useful for trucks and buses not only because it would save on labour costs and operation, but because it could operate 24 hours a day.” 
Semi-autonomous ‘platoons’ of trucks from around Europe will travel to Rotterdam in early April as part of an experiment backed by the Dutch Council presidency.
Vienna Convention needs updating
Despite the Commission’s enthusiasm, this isn’t low-hanging fruit. It isn’t only the EU that is causing regulatory uncertainty in this field. Globally, rules on driving are harmonised by the UN’s 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.
Joost Vantomme, smart mobility Director at the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), said the rules need to be clarified. “Article eight says you need to have a driver in the vehicle, and they need to be in control of the vehicle,” he said. “But what is a driver? Can it be a computer? And what does it mean to be in control of the vehicle?”
As the technology for automated driving has called article eight into question, different countries have interpreted these rules differently. Antti Vehviläinen, director-general of the Finnish Transport Agency, told the conference that Finland has chosen a loose interpretation. “The driver does not need to be in the car, he just needs to be in control,” he said.
The EU’s early efforts at clarification could mean that the bloc ends up setting the standards later adopted at the UN. It can take four to five years to modify a UN treaty, and work has not even begun yet.
Public worry
But is automated driving really the vote-winner that the Commission is imagining? There was much worry at the conference that fears over driverless cars are going to trump the benefits. What will someone think if they are driving on the motorway and see a driverless car next to them?
In Gothenburg Sweden, they’re about to find out. Volvo is launching a project this year called DriveMe, which will put driverless vehicles on real roads with other drivers. The company wants to test how other drivers react, as well as other safety considerations.
The safety worries are a significant hurdle. At a special break-away panel dedicated to the human factors in CAD, most people agreed that people will over-trust automation and this could present dangers. Almost everyone agreed that operating an automated vehicle should require special training, and half said vehicles should alert others when they are in automated mode.
This will be a difficult question for regulators, Viegas admitted. “A minister will know that giving approval today and then having a fatal accident tomorrow will result in him being fired,” he said. “You need to be able to guarantee that the automated vehicle would not fail in a scenario in which a human would not fail.”
Still, the mood at the Brussels conference was positive. There was a general consensus that, as long as safety concerns can be addressed, the EU is on to a winner by identifying autonomous vehicles as an area where it will demonstrate innovation leadership and quick regulatory adjustment.
“Imagine on our roads trucks platooning with big signs saying ‘Europe on the move’,” said Roberto Vavassori, president of the European automotive suppliers association CLEPA. “It would be a sign that EU legislation is there to improve quality of life for our people,” he told the conference enthusiastically.



Autonomous driving levels 0 to 5: Understanding the differences
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted the Society of Automotive Engineers' (SAE) levels for automated driving systems, ranging from complete driver control to full autonomy. 
By Hope Reese | January 20, 20X-1, 10:47 AM PST 
Between Tesla's announcement that every car in production will now have the capability for full autonomy by 20XX+1 and the Obama administration's plan to invest almost $4 billion in autonomous vehicle research over the next 10 years, the race to create the best driverless car has never been hotter.
The rise of driverless vehicles is going to have a major impact on businesses and professionals. Automated vehicles could replace corporate fleets for deliveries or transporting employees, for example. And workers could gain productive hours in the day by working instead of driving during daily commutes. Innovations in this field are also poised to completely change the car insurance industry by reducing accidents—a new report predicts that accidents will drop by 80% by 20XX+20
But, what does ""autonomous driving"" really mean? The US Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defined five different levels of autonomous driving. In October 20XX-1, the NHTSA updated their policy to reflect that they have officially adopted the levels of autonomy outlined in the SAE International's J3016 document.
The NHTSA is ""working to transform government for the 21st century, harnessing innovation and technology that will improve people's lives,"" according to a representative. ""This is an area of rapid change, which requires the Department Of Transport and NHTSA to remain flexible and adaptable as new information and technologies emerge. Amid that rapid change, the North Star for Department Of Transport and NHTSA remains safety."" 
It's important to remember that the levels of autonomy describe the system, not the vehicle, said Bryant Walker Smith, professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law and School of Engineering and one of the top experts in the driverless cars world. ""A Level 5 automated driving system could be in a vehicle with or without a steering wheel,"" he explained.
Here's what you need to know about levels 0-5. The biggest difference is that, starting at Level 3, the automated driving system becomes able to monitor the driving environment.
Level 0: This one is pretty basic. The driver (human) controls it all: steering, brakes, throttle, power. It's what you've been doing all along.
Level 1: This driver-assistance level means that most functions are still controlled by the driver, but a specific function (like steering or accelerating) can be done automatically by the car.
Level 2: In level 2, at least one driver assistance system of ""both steering and acceleration/ deceleration using information about the driving environment"" is automated, like cruise control and lane-centering. It means that the ""driver is disengaged from physically operating the vehicle by having his or her hands off the steering wheel AND foot off pedal at the same time,"" according to the SAE. The driver must still always be ready to take control of the vehicle, however. 
Level 3: Drivers are still necessary in level 3 cars, but are able to completely shift ""safety-critical functions"" to the vehicle, under certain traffic or environmental conditions. It means that the driver is still present and will intervene if necessary, but is not required to monitor the situation in the same way it does for the previous levels. Jim McBride, autonomous vehicles expert at Ford, said this is ""the biggest demarcation is between Levels 3 and 4."" He's focused on getting Ford straight to Level 4, since Level 3, which involves transferring control from car to human, can often pose difficulties. ""We're not going to ask the driver to instantaneously intervene—that's not a fair proposition,"" McBride said.
Level 4: This is what is meant by ""fully autonomous."" Level 4 vehicles are ""designed to perform all safety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip."" However, it's important to note that this is limited to the ""operational design domain (ODD)"" of the vehicle - meaning it does not cover every driving scenario.
Level 5: This refers to a fully-autonomous system that expects the vehicle's performance to equal that of a human driver, in every driving scenario—including extreme environments like dirt roads that are unlikely to be navigated by driverless vehicles in the near future. 
Why it matters
So why are the levels important? They serve as general guidelines for how technologically advanced a vehicle is. In terms of what consumers need to know, Thilo Koslowski, former analyst for Gartner, thinks that ultimately, there are three stages that will be relevant: ""automated, autonomous, and driverless."" It's important to distinguish between ""autonomous"" and ""driverless,"" he said: ""driverless is a more advanced stage of autonomous.""
But while drivers themselves may be less concerned with the distinctions, the differences could be significant when it comes to issues like car insurance, which is expected to change radically in the era of self-driving cars. 
KPMG, a consulting firm, has issued a report on how the car insurance business will be affected, since the number of accidents are predicted to go down 80% over the coming 20 years. The different levels are important because they ""change the risk profile of the car,"" according to KPMG expert Jerry Albright. ""Insurance companies need to understand how these new capabilities affect driving risk."" Joe Schneider, managing director at KPMG, put it this way: ""It's like a baby, going from crawling to walking to running."" Albright said, ""The car becomes safer and safer as it moves towards fully-autonomous driving.""

Challenges for automated vehicles in the EU

The potential impact of the deployment of automated vehicles raises many questions. The answers are still under discussion, having ethical, legal, financial, economic and technical dimensions. While most of the scientific discussion has to date dealt with the development of the technology, the focus recently is shifting towards topics such as user acceptance and legal issues. Policy makers, in particular, face challenges in designing the appropriate legal and regulatory framework so that new technologies are used properly and for the benefit of society.

Legal framework for road safety

Regulation of automated vehicles faces challenges to establish rules for technologies not yet applied. In particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed. Traffic rules and the regulatory framework need to be adapted. In addition, it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom. The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of driving education and licensing.

Infrastructure and technical standards

Automated and connected vehicles need special features in infrastructure. What needs to be done at the infrastructure level has yet to be clarified. An important prerequisite for intelligent transport systems will be an agreement on what communication is needed between vehicles (V2V), between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) and vehicles to anyone else. Technical standardisation is necessary for international compatibility and interoperability.

Data processing

The new technologies raise questions as to how data privacy and cyber security will be addressed. The highly or fully automated vehicle will process data and make decisions: this raises ethical issues which have to be solved in a societal dialogue. The programmed algorithms will make decisions in conflicting situations, such as a choice between two unavoidable crash scenarios. How will the decision be taken? What 'best driving behaviour' should be reflected by the system?

Liability issues

In case of malfunction of an automated vehicle, who is liable when such malfunctions result in an accident: the manufacturer, the owner or the driver has to be clarified.




Examples for the different levels of automation

Level 0 - Park Distance Control (already deployed): The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals.

Level 1 - Park Assist (already deployed): The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces. The system assists the driver by automatically carrying out the optimum steering movements in order to reverse - park on the ideal line. The measurement of the parking space, the allocation of the starting position and the steering movements are automatically undertaken – all the driver has to do is operate the accelerator and the brake. This means that the driver retains control of the car at all times.

Level 2 - Traffic Jam Assist (already deployed): The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h). The system can be seen as an extension of the Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop&Go functionality, i.e. no lane change support.

Level 3 - Traffic Jam Chauffeur (already deployed): Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads. The system can be activated in a traffic jam scenario. It detects a slow-driving vehicle in front and then handles the vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Later versions of this functionality might include lane change functionality.

Level 4 - Highway Pilot (possible deployment 20XX+4): Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver must deliberately activate the system, but does not have to monitor it constantly. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. There is no request from the system to the driver to take over when the system is in its normal operation area on the motorway. Depending on the deployment of vehicle-to-vehicle communication and cooperative systems, ad-hoc convoys could also be created.

Level 5 – The fully automated vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger. According to ERTRAC only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10.




Self-driving cars could cost America's professional drivers up to 25,000 jobs a month, Goldman Sachs says

Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan 
Published 2:45 PM ET Mon, 22 May 20XX
The full impact of self-driving cars on society is several decades away — but when it hits, the job losses will be substantial for American truck drivers, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs. When autonomous vehicle saturation peaks, U.S. drivers could see job losses at a rate of 25,000 a month, or 300,000 a year, according to a report from Goldman Sachs Economics Research. Truck drivers, more so than bus or taxi drivers, will see the bulk of that job loss, according to the report. That makes sense, given today's employment: In 20XX-3, there were 4 million driver jobs in the U.S., 3.1 million of which were truck drivers, Goldman said. That represents 2 per cent of total employment. The report estimates that semi- and fully autonomous car sales will have about 20 per cent share of car sales around 20XX+10. The report comes as fierce competition to make self-driving cars is shaking up companies from the inside out. 
Uber formally launched Uber Freight last week with a self-driving executive at the helm, expanding its reach in the trucking industry, even as it fights in court with Alphabet over whether some of its technology is stolen. And at Ford, the CEO will be replaced by a self-driving car expert, in an effort to ""transform Ford for the future."" Near term, the analysts predict that occupations like secretaries, cashiers, bank tellers, waiters and real estate agents could also be at risk of automation.
To be sure, the report estimates that the full effects of self-driving cars will be delayed by regulation and slow adoption. The report as a whole strikes an optimistic tone on the future of the labor market, noting that many different employment and productivity measures in the United States do not show massive disruption from labor-replacing technologies. 
Industries like department stores, telecom, printing, publishing and manufacturing have seen the biggest job losses over the past 13 years, while sectors like food services, education, computer design and home healthcare have been winners, the report said. ""Demand for health care, education and food services is likely to rise further with aggregate income, and should also benefit from broader trends including aging and consumers' desire for new experiences,"" the report said. ""More fundamentally, we suspect that several of the skills central to those sectors — including empathy, humor, creativity and problem solving — are hard to codify and automate.""",29,7.3,"Summary

The text provides an in-depth look into the future of automated or driverless cars. 
It covers their potentials and challenges, different levels of automation, regulatory and legal frameworks, and the ongoing work within the European Union. 
The thesis appears to argue that driverless cars have transformative potential but require comprehensive legislation and ethical considerations.

Briefing on driveless cars
Today is 16 November 20XX
 
Introduction-Background information
Automated vehicle technologies allow the transfer of driving functions from a human driver to a computer. Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility and will create challenges. As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure. It has also the potential to be more environmentally friendly, efficient and accessible. However, automated vehicle technologies require an effective regulatory and legislative framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of legitimate concerns.
1. Potentials and challenges of vehicle automation
The potential impact of the deployment of automated vehicles has several aspects with technical, financial, economic, legal and ethical dimensions. 
Driverless cars will reform transportation as we know it by improoving our lives. Their adoption will slash accident and fatality rates, saving millions of lives. It will remove one-third to one-half of all vehicles from city streets because self-driving cars don’t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers. 
Eliminating human drivers will also allow automobile designers to build cars from a completely different mind set.The A.I. system driving the car will also reduce accidents to negligible levels. With no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient.
From economic aspect, car sharing will cost a fraction of what car ownership today costs. Owning a car for daily, personal transportation will seem impractical while workers could gain productive hours in the day by working instead of driving during daily commutes.
Innovations in this field are also poised to completely change the car insurance industry by reducing accidents—a new report predicts that accidents will drop by 80% by 20XX+20
At the same time policy makers, face challenges in designing the appropriate legal and regulatory framework so that new technologies are used properly and for the benefit of society.
The rapid development of robots/automated cars might result in changes in the labour market through the creation, displacement and loss of certain jobs for example the replacement of corporate fleets for deliveries or transporting employees will push up the unemployment. 
Last but not least, the growing use of robotics  raises ethical issues concerning privacy and safety. The new technologies raise questions as to how data privacy and cyber security will be addressed. The highly or fully automated vehicle will process data and make decisions: this raises ethical issues which have to be solved in a societal dialogue. The programmed algorithms will make decisions in conflicting situations, such as a choice between two unavoidable crash scenarios. How will the decision be taken? What 'best driving behaviour' should be reflected by the system? A possible solution could be a voluntary ethical code of conduct on robotics for researchers and designers to ensure that they operate in accordance with legal and ethical standards and that robot design and use respect human dignity.
2. The different levels of automation and their deployment
But, what does ""autonomous driving"" really mean? The US Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defined five different levels of autonomous driving.The levels are six (0-5).
Level 0 - Park Distance Control (already deployed): The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals.
Level 1 - Park Assist (already deployed): The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces. The system assists the driver by automatically carrying out the optimum steering movements in order to reverse - park on the ideal line. However, the driver has to operate the accelerator and the brake having the control of the car at all times.
Level 2 - Traffic Jam Assist (already deployed): The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h). The system can be seen as an extension of the Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop&Go functionality, i.e. no lane change support.
Level 3 - Traffic Jam Chauffeur (already deployed): Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads. The system can be activated in a traffic jam scenario. It detects a slow-driving vehicle in front and then handles the vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Later versions of this functionality might include lane change functionality.
Level 4 - Highway Pilot (possible deployment 20XX+4): Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver must deliberately activate the system, but does not have to monitor it constantly. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. There is no request from the system to the driver to take over when the system is in its normal operation area on the motorway. Depending on the deployment of vehicle-to-vehicle communication and cooperative systems, ad-hoc convoys could also be created.
Level 5 – The fully automated vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger. According to ERTRAC only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10.
 
3. Regulatory and legal frameworks, state of play
Road traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness.
One of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept, as laid down in Article 8, that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. The amended convention (20XX-1) still demands that every vehicle must have a driver. However, in the future it will be in accordance with the Convention that highly automated systems will have a driver who may take the hands off the wheel, but must be ready at all times to take over the driving functions, and who can override the system and switch it on and off. A further amendment process is therefore necessary to permit driverless vehicles. Systems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.
The regulatory environment relating to cyber security, data privacy, and liability issues is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles. Regulation of automated vehicles faces challenges to establish rules for technologies not yet applied. In particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed. Traffic rules and the regulatory framework need to be adapted. In addition, it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom. The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of driving education and licensing.
EU Commission should be ready to propose rules on robotics and artificial intelligence, in order to fully exploit their economic potential and to guarantee a standard level of safety and security. As regulatory standards for robots are being planned in several countries, the EU needs to take the lead on setting these standards, so as not to be forced to follow those set by third countries.
Traffic accidents have very large costs in economic terms, in particular regarding human lives or health, or regarding damage to an object. Liability law answers the question of who is responsible and who has to bear the costs of an accident. Relevant legislation is urgently needed to clarify liability issues, especially for self-driving cars. A mandatory insurance scheme and a supplementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driverless cars are fully compensated is needed. In addition, a specific legal status for robots in the long run, should be established in order to identify who is liable if they cause damage.
Regarding ethics the creation of a European agency for robotics and artificial intelligence, to supply public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise should be considered.
4.  Ongoing work in the EU
In the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products (Council Directive 85/374/EEC). A producer is liable for any damage caused by a defect in his product; a product is defective when it does not provide the safety which the consumer is entitled to expect. However, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved — the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States.
Systems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.
The debate on data privacy regarding connected automated vehicles is evolving in parallel with the new technologies. In general, digital services will be available in vehicles, as they are anywhere else. As third parties can access and use sensitive driver and driving data, legislation seems necessary to protect personal privacy of consumers in connected vehicles.The new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regard to digital technologies, valid across the EU.
The EP resently (16-03-20xx) voted a resolution for the establishment of EU legislation for the fast-evolving field of robotics, e.g. to enforce ethical standards or establish liability for accidents involving driverless cars. In addition, the European Commission promised dedicated funding, regulatory changes, cross-border agreements and innovation stimulus. The first step in a roadmap, was published by the Commission as part of its transport strategy last May, that could see driverless cars integrated with traffic by 20XX+10."

Dear [your name],
Welcome to your first day in the unit! You will have to hit the ground running - we have received an urgent request for a briefing. Our Director-General, Ms Heinrich, needs a summary of state of play concerning the draft revised animal welfare regulation, for her decision on the way forward.
As you have seen in the draft regulation text, we have followed the “preferred options” identified in our thorough impact assessment (those marked green in the impact assessment options table). This draft legislative proposal is what we as DG SANTE believe best serves our policy objectives and this is what we need to defend as far as possible. We received strong support for an ambition line in all the stakeholder consultations.
In the recent inter-service consultation, we also received green light (positive opinion) by all DGs except one. DG AGRI has unfortunately not been able to accept our draft legislative proposal. This means we will either need to make small compromise adjustments to the original proposal and change our preferred option, or we try to somehow convince DG AGRI to accept our main line.
In your briefing, please outline the main issues at hand and explain the options for next step so that our Director-General can make an informed decision on it. She did invite us to already make a recommendation based on our knowledge of the file if we have a preference.
You should keep the briefing short and concise, no more than two pages.
I have placed a file with various materials on your desk. It should contain what you need for the draft briefing. Please have a first version done already today at X o’clock so I can check it before passing it on to Ms Heinrich.
Thank","you and best of luck,

Attachment 5: Press statement

Brussels, April 202X-2
Every year across the European Union, around three hundred million farmed animals are confined in cages. Unable to conduct many of their natural behaviours, these animals are treated as nothing more than production machines. No single EU Member State is completely cage free and in some Member States up to 90% of all hens, mother pigs and young calves are kept in cages and crates. This despite farming industry having had more than 15 years to voluntarily change their installations.
Over 170 organisations and caring citizens across Europe therefore joined forces to spearhead the “End the Cage Age” European citizens’ initiative. In total, 1.4 million EU citizens made their voices heard and signed the petition. Only one other citizen’s initiative has so far gathered more signatures than this.
Mr Daniel Müller, campaign leader for “End the Cage Age” said: what we see now is the battle of ethics versus economy. EU citizens do not want cheap food at any cost and certainly not at the cost of pain and suffering of our fellow creatures. Food industry and economic interests will have to adapt to this reality – and finally do what is right.
In response to our tireless campaigning, in April 202X-2, the European Commission committed to proposing legislation before the end of 202X to phase out and finally prohibit the use of animal cages. We must now ensure that a total ban on caged farming is delivered, as soon as possible. The fight also continues to pave the way not only for a cage-free Europe, but for a cage-free world by making sure that all imported products in the EU comply with cage-free standards.


Attachment 6: Website

What is a citizens' initiative?
A European citizens’ initiative is a way for you and other Europeans to take an active part in EU policymaking.
If you want the EU to act on a particular issue, you can launch a citizens’ initiative calling on the European Commission to propose new EU legislation on that issue.
For an initiative to be considered by the Commission, you need to get one million citizens from across the EU to sign it in support.
Step 1: Get started
Before launching an initiative, it is worth considering some of the key practical aspects, including:
is asking for EU legislation to be passed the best way to achieve your goals?
you must first set up a group of organisers composed of at least 7 EU citizens living in seven different EU countries. To do so, you need to find people to team up with across Europe who are willing to support your issue.
how will you organise your campaign to collect the signatures?
You can find detailed advice on all these issues on the European Citizens’ Initiative Forum




Step 2: Get your initiative registered
Before you can start collecting signatures for your initiative, you must ask the Commission to register it.
For this, you will need to:
create an organiser account. You will use this to manage your initiative and liaise with the Commission throughout its lifecycle.
provide a description of your initiative in one of the official EU languages (as well as details and relevant documents on the group of organisers, funding received, etc.)
The Commission is not obliged to register all initiatives. It only registers initiatives that meet certain criteria.
Once you ask for your initiative to be registered, we will assess whether to accept it.
You will receive an answer within 2-4 months.


Step 3: Get support
You need to get the support of at least one million people, with minimum numbers in at least seven EU countries. They must fill in a specific statement of support form.
You can collect:
on paper (pre-filled forms, downloadable from your organiser account) or
online (using the Central Online Collection System).
These forms are available in all EU official languages.
To sign, people must be:
EU nationals (nationals of an EU country)
old enough to vote in European elections or aged at least 16 in some countries
TIP – It is better to collect more signatures than you need. Sometimes the authorities in each country might not be able to validate all the statements of support you provide. Throughout the collection procedure, you must comply with data protection rules.


Step 4: Submit your initiative
Once you have received the last certificate from the national authorities, you have 3 months to submit your initiative to the Commission – together with the information on the support and funding you have received for the initiative.


What next?
If the Commission considers legislation an appropriate response to your initiative, it will start preparing a formal proposal. This can require preparatory steps like public consultations, impact assessments, etc. Once adopted by the Commission, the proposal is submitted to the European Parliament and the EU Council (or in some cases, only to the Council), which will need to adopt it for it to become law.
The Commission is not obliged to propose legislation. Even where it responds positively, the most appropriate follow-up to an initiative may be non-legislative in nature. There are a range of other measures that may be more suitable.
The European Parliament may also assess the measures taken by the Commission.

Dear Wiebke,
Just a heads-up about the AGRI response to your animal welfare ISC - you will receive it later today. We can accept all of it, but we have a remaining concern about the proposed new rules for poultry cage rearing.
First, the proposed exception for farms less than 50 livestock units (3500 laying hens) does not make much sense. The overwhelming majority of eggs produced in the EU come from farms with more than 5000 birds (70 livestock units) and the smaller farms can anyway more easily transition to cage-free rearing if they haven’t done so already.
Longer transition time also does not help, it’s not about more time for farms to adapt. It’s about the money and about food prices.
For large-scale installations, cages are simply more efficient and use much less space. With your proposal, notably the requirement of more space per laying hen, production will necessarily be less cost-efficient, and most farms will not be able to keep the same number of birds. Consumers might say they care about animal welfare but when they make their choices in the supermarket, the thing that matters most is the price! If you implement the new rules, the price of eggs might increase by around 20-40% in countries like Spain, Portugal, and Malta where cage systems are still the norm. This means we will see a significant increase in cheap imported eggs from third countries with much worse animal welfare standards. Our European farmers cannot compete on such unfair terms.
There is also the socioeconomic element: the burden of higher food prices will be heavier on the poorest families.
Unless farmers can be compensated economically somehow for taking this risk, we don’t see any need for changing the current rules on poultry caging and we will need to block your proposal.

Call me if you want to discuss this further.

Best,
Michael


Attachment 8: Press release


MEPs endorse EU citizens’ call for gradual end to caged farming
Press releases – AGRI - 20 February 202X-2

The European Parliament has called for the end of caged farming within the next 5 years. The parliament members voted on an own initiative resolution recommending a total ban on the use of cages in animal agriculture by 202X+3.
The vote followed intensive lobbying by the “End the Cage Age” European Citizens Initiative, led by 170 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) across Europe, which garnered 1.4m signatures from EU citizens and demanded the phasing out of cages on farms. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted by 558 to 37 with 85 abstentions on the non-binding resolution.
Unlevel playing field in Europe
Even though the EU has banned the use of battery cages in poultry production and sow stalls during gestation, campaigners said this was not enough, given the perceived unlevel playing field across Europe with some nations already going beyond EU laws.
According to the initiative, five out of 28 countries are currently achieving more than 80% cage-free production, i.e., Austria (97%), Luxembourg (97%), Sweden (92%), Germany (86%) and the Netherlands (82%). Bottom of the list is Malta, with 1%, followed by Spain and Portugal. About sows, the report is based on Eurostat figures, according to the initiative’s website.
In the European Parliament, a working group on cage-free farming established in 202X-10 has been actively supporting the “End the Cage Age” initiative and in October 202X-3, 101 MEPs from various political parties signed a letter of support addressed to EU Commissioners.
Speeding up the review of animal welfare legislation
Last month, the parliament’s AGRI committee adopted a motion for a resolution. Committee members called on the European Commission to speed up the review of the animal welfare legislation and back the phasing out of all cages in farming, possibly already by 202X+3. They also insisted on ensuring compliance with EU standards for all products imported into the EU.
By April this year, the European Commission will have made its decision as to whether to start a legislative process to ban caged farming. EU Food Safety commissioner Stella Kyriakides told MEPs that the Commission was considering a request contained within the resolution to apply the same animal welfare standards to meat imported from outside the EU as European farmers must meet inside the bloc.
Kyriakides also noted the call for farmers to receive compensation and support in their transition from cages. She added the phase-out would happen “as soon as feasible” but did not give a specific date.
The results for pork production could be far-reaching, as it would likely change the current practice using farrowing crates. In recent years, a lot of research initiatives have already been launched to design free farrowing concepts.

Subject: Cages and antibiotics

Dear Ms Munoz,
Congratulations on your concluded impact assessment on the animal welfare regulation!
In view of your upcoming drafting process, I need to point out that there are several scientific studies pointing to higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, notably among e-coli bacteria, in non-cage housing systems for poultry - if not implemented correctly and with strict quality standards. I feel this did not come out clearly enough from your impact assessment.
Free-range egg production systems face more challenges related to biosecurity and use of antibiotics. The free-range layer birds have more interaction with each other compared to caged ones, leading to an increased incidence of infectious poultry diseases requiring treatment with antimicrobials, in turn leading to increased emergence of resistant commensal and pathogenic bacteria. This is a major threat to public health.
The main factor to consider is of course, as always, the number of hens per square meter, the hygiene routines, and the overall rules on veterinary prescription of antibiotics. It is the same for pigs: sows in small crates have low life quality but use less medication; pigs in free range but packed close together require lots of antibiotics and pigs in free range with sufficient space are more healthy and less prone to cause antimicrobial resistance. However, they are also much less cost-effective for industrial-size farming. 
Still, to ensure safe food production and avoid antibiotics resistance, livestock density simply must go down. 
If you could take these concerns into account in your draft revised regulation, we would be much grateful.

Best regards,
Ana Calbi

To address the specific objectives of the animal welfare legislation revision, four policy measures have been considered, with low, medium, and high ambition options. Impacts assessed include cost-efficiency, environmental and societal impacts and impacts on the single market. The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) has confirmed the scientific evidence. Numerous stakeholder consultations and supporting studies have been performed.
For animals kept for economic purposes, the measures/options covered are:
1) 	Phasing out confining cages/crates for the following species and categories of animals:
Pigs
Calves
Laying hens and pullets
Rabbits and fur-producing animals.
A general transition period of between five and twelve years would be considered, depending on the level of ambition. Exceptions e.g., depending on farm size (number of “livestock units” where 1 livestock unit = 1 cow, or 2 pigs, or 71 laying hens) could be considered.
2) 	Banning the killing of day-old male chicks (or, as an alternative option, introducing an obligation of marking eggs from production systems where day-old chicks are killed). In the case of a ban, while a transition period of five years would be technically sufficient, notably if combined with stricter import rules, the impacts could be mitigated by introducing a ten years’ transition period.

3) 	Banning painful mutilations, i.e., beak trimming in poultry and tail docking in pigs (with incentives instead of bans as alternative options). For the bans, a general transition period of ten years has been considered. Incentives for voluntary action would enter into force immediately.
  
4) 	Animal welfare requirements at import. For animals and products of animal origin imported to the EU, either similar or fully equivalent animal welfare requirements with the revised EU animal welfare requirements for kept animals, as regards the use of cages, mutilations, space allowances, enrichment, the killing of day-old chicks and the welfare of fur animals would apply. A transition period of five-ten years has been considered.

A phase-out of the use of cages and stalls would considerably improve the welfare of more than 160 million laying hens, 53 million pullets (young hens), 13 million sows, two million calves, 35 million ducks and geese and 100 million rabbits. They would be able to perform a more natural and healthy behaviour.
A partial or total ban on cages and crates would have an important economic impact on the sectors concerned. For instance, for laying hens we have estimated the required investments for a transition into a cage-free system to about EUR 2,4-2,8 billion. For sows, the cost of demolishing the current system with gestation and farrowing crates could amount to around EUR 64-100 /m². These costs are likely to result in higher consumer prices. 
The situation however differs between Member States. Some have already taken measures to phase out cages and stalls whereas others have not. 
To mitigate these economic impacts, certain measures could be considered, notably awareness-raising vis-à-vis consumers, economic incentives via the Common Agricultural Policy and import rules to ensure a level playing field / reduce unfair competition.
The proposed measures would ensure a positive impact on sustainability as it would imply less intensive food production, causing less pollution to air and water. However, since cage-free animals move around more, they spend more energy and consume more feed. This could have a negative impact on the use of resources.

Background
Since 202X-10, EU legislation requires that laying hens be kept either in enriched cages, or alternative systems (single or multi-tier barn or, free-range). The current legislation allows calves being individually housed until the age of eight weeks, while sows and gilts are kept in confinement for a period of four weeks after service and from one week before the expected time of farrowing to weaning of their piglets. 
Approximately one million farms keep laying hens in the EU. Forty-five percent of these are kept in enriched cages. 
There is currently a trend towards using less cages in many EU Member States such as France, the Netherlands and Poland to answer to consumer’s expectations. E.g., Austria and Luxembourg have already banned the use of cages for laying hens. The animal welfare problems related to cages will however remain for many laying hens if no action is taken at EU level.

Problem drivers
Conventional livestock production systems across EU countries are put under pressure by competitive global markets, a rise in input costs and the search for maximum profit margins by farmers and all food business operators along the production chain. The demand of certain consumers’ segments for low price food is expected to be more prevalent in the current inflationary context.
This pressure over production costs has led to further intensification (and specialisation) of the farming and killing practices, as business operators increase the volume of production to reduce overheads costs per livestock unit. Evidence shows that, while the number of livestock farms is decreasing, their size is increasing. Small farms are replaced by very large industrial scale installations.
This trend has led to certain detrimental effects on animal welfare due to high densities, certain management practices, housing/transport conditions and stunning methods, as well as due to certain breeding strategies.
Current EU rules also do not consider new scientific evidence and huge technological developments in relation to agricultural practices, zootechnics and transport operations. For instance, this new scientific evidence relates to a new understanding of stocking densities, behaviour (need for an enriched environment), mutilation practices, journey times and space allowances for animal transports, and stunning methods used for pigs, poultry, and farmed fish.
The lack of update of the EU animal welfare legislation has led Member States to adopt an increasing number of national measures going beyond EU minimum requirements to respond to the growing citizens’ concerns towards animal welfare, leading to a fragmented legal landscape, including as regards animal welfare labelling.
At the same time, consumers are growing more aware and more demanding. The upward trend of societal demands for better animal welfare protection is not reflected in the current legislative requirements. 

Figure 1: Problem tree 

Economic and environmental impacts of the preferred package of options: cages for laying hens
The policy option assessed to be most cost-efficient is a total prohibition on the use of cages for laying hens with a transition period of 5 years (from the date of entry into force of the revised legislation).
However, if no similar requirements apply for eggs and egg products imported into the EU from third countries, since the EU consumers’ demand for eggs is not expected to decrease and since EU production is expected to decrease, an increase in eggs obtained from caged hens imported from non-EU countries with lower standards is expected, thus limiting the positive animal welfare impact of the measure.
The required investments for a transition into a cage-free system for laying hens would amount to around EUR 2,4-2,8 billion.
A prohibition of cages would decrease the number of laying hens by an estimated 30% (i.e., from 186,8 million to 102,9 million) in farms which currently have cage systems.

SME’s
Small farms tend to use cage-free systems more than big farms. A prohibition would therefore primarily have a positive competitiveness impact on small farms.

Public authorities
It is likely that a prohibition would generate additional enforcement costs in the short term for the national competent authorities, however these will come back to current levels in the medium term.

Consumers
A prohibition would lead to an expected increase in the price of eggs, but to which extent is not clear. Some estimates by the EU poultry industry suggest a + 20% price gap between eggs from cages and those from barn systems. However, sales data from the Netherlands and Germany suggests a much smaller difference in prices: less than one eurocent per egg.
With an average per capita consumption of 210 eggs per year, or 4,04 eggs per week, this would mean that transitioning to cage-free systems would add less than four eurocents per person to consumers’ weekly food shopping bill. Furthermore, the experience from Germany, where enriched cages are progressively phased out, even suggests that the price for barn eggs may eventually be the same as for eggs from enriched cages.
 
Environmental impacts
A prohibition would have a positive impact on sustainability as it would imply less intensive production leading to less air and water pollution and less greenhouse gas emissions.

Health and food safety Commissioner will fight for ethical food systems in Europe
30 October 202X-3
Earlier today, Commissioner Kyriakides met with the representatives of the citizens’ initiative ‘End the Cage Age’. EURACTIV interviewed the Commissioner after her meeting with the campaign team.
Stella Kyriakides is European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety and in charge of the EU animal welfare legislation. She spoke to EURACTIV about the call for revised animal welfare legislation and the possibility for action ahead.
This is one of the most strongly supported citizens’ initiatives so far with almost 1.4 million signatures collected. How will the Commission respond to all who signed this petition?
I am impressed by the hard work by these dedicated young people. I promised them today that the Commission will investigate this very carefully.
In fact, we recently completed a review of our legislation and have found that there is indeed scope for improvement. However, first we will hear the views of the European Parliament and we will consult across the Commission services and then reply about next steps.
Your colleague, the Commissioner for Agriculture, is less enthusiastic. How will you get the farming community onboard?
As always, there will be a balancing act between several interests. Farmers produce the food we eat and they deserve to be heard as well. Many farmers also already made this transition, showing it is possible to rear animals cage-free.
The Commission always performs a thorough impact assessment, so any legislative proposal will be based on solid facts and on careful consideration of all relevant impacts. We always seek a sustainable compromise.
There could also be other possibilities to make animal welfare more attractive for farmers by e.g., economic incentives, subsidies, trade schemes and awareness campaigns. It is not just about laws and penalties.
On the other hand, I think the farming industry has known for a long time that this is coming, they have had plenty of time to prepare and many Member States have in fact already taken significant steps in the direction of free-range animal rearing.
But is there not a risk that ‘money will talk’, how can you weigh the economic impacts against animal suffering – how will the comparison be done in an impact assessment?
No, economic interests are not the only interests we take into account. It is true that our assessment is expressed as a cost-benefit ratio, but among those ‘benefits’, we consider also softer values such as social, health and environmental impacts – and ethical choices. I guarantee you that industry interests will not dominate this process. 
On the contrary, I think what we see here is a strong message from European citizens that animal rights and animal welfare must be respected, and I agree with them. We cannot ignore this question any longer.",26,6.0,"Summary

Briefing Note on the draft revised animal welfare regulation, version 1 June 202X
Introduction - In April 202X-2, the European Commission committed to proposing legislation before the end of 202X to phase out the use of animal cages, with a view to eventually prohibit them. This echoes growing concerns among the European population for what regards animal welfare. This Note aims to provide an analysis of the situation, the reasoning behind the proposed regulation and its potential benefits. 
Main argument - The proposed regulation will enhance animal welfare by introducing a system whereby the use of animal cages will be gradually phased out. This will also serve the purpose of providing an answer to growing concerns among the European population for the welfare of animals, which -as is widely documented- is an important topic for many citizens. However, there are significant challenges to this initiative. The changes that will need to be implemented if the new piece of legislation is adopted will pose several significant challenges:
- costs incurred by farmers to comply with new standards can be seen as disproportionate
- higher food prices will negatively impact the poorest families
The Directorate General is well aware of the importance of the policy objectives and the need to mitigate its negative consequences for both producers and consumers. On the long-run, the long-term sustainability of our agricultural sector will be enhanced.
Conclusion - By proposing this new piece of legislation, the Commission aims to strike a balance between agricultural productivity and and the long term well-being of our agricultural sector."

Dear [your name],
Welcome to your first day in the unit! You will have to hit the ground running - we have received an urgent request for a briefing. Our Director-General, Ms Heinrich, needs a summary of state of play concerning the draft revised animal welfare regulation, for her decision on the way forward.
As you have seen in the draft regulation text, we have followed the “preferred options” identified in our thorough impact assessment (those marked green in the impact assessment options table). This draft legislative proposal is what we as DG SANTE believe best serves our policy objectives and this is what we need to defend as far as possible. We received strong support for an ambition line in all the stakeholder consultations.
In the recent inter-service consultation, we also received green light (positive opinion) by all DGs except one. DG AGRI has unfortunately not been able to accept our draft legislative proposal. This means we will either need to make small compromise adjustments to the original proposal and change our preferred option, or we try to somehow convince DG AGRI to accept our main line.
In your briefing, please outline the main issues at hand and explain the options for next step so that our Director-General can make an informed decision on it. She did invite us to already make a recommendation based on our knowledge of the file if we have a preference.
You should keep the briefing short and concise, no more than two pages.
I have placed a file with various materials on your desk. It should contain what you need for the draft briefing. Please have a first version done already today at X o’clock so I can check it before passing it on to Ms Heinrich.

Attachment 5: Press statement

Brussels, April 202X-2
Every year across the European Union, around three hundred million farmed animals are confined in cages. Unable to conduct many of their natural behaviours, these animals are treated as nothing more than production machines. No single EU Member State is completely cage free and in some Member States up to 90% of all hens, mother pigs and young calves are kept in cages and crates. This despite farming industry having had more than 15 years to voluntarily change their installations.
Over 170 organisations and caring citizens across Europe therefore joined forces to spearhead the “End the Cage Age” European citizens’ initiative. In total, 1.4 million EU citizens made their voices heard and signed the petition. Only one other citizen’s initiative has so far gathered more signatures than this.
Mr Daniel Müller, campaign leader for “End the Cage Age” said: what we see now is the battle of ethics versus economy. EU citizens do not want cheap food at any cost and certainly not at the cost of pain and suffering of our fellow creatures. Food industry and economic interests will have to adapt to this reality – and finally do what is right.
In response to our tireless campaigning, in April 202X-2, the European Commission committed to proposing legislation before the end of 202X to phase out and finally prohibit the use of animal cages. We must now ensure that a total ban on caged farming is delivered, as soon as possible. The fight also continues to pave the way not only for a cage-free Europe, but for a cage-free world by making sure that all imported products in the EU comply with cage-free standards.


Attachment 6: Website

What is a citizens' initiative?
A European citizens’ initiative is a way for you and other Europeans to take an active part in EU policymaking.
If you want the EU to act on a particular issue, you can launch a citizens’ initiative calling on the European Commission to propose new EU legislation on that issue.
For an initiative to be considered by the Commission, you need to get one million citizens from across the EU to sign it in support.
Step 1: Get started
Before launching an initiative, it is worth considering some of the key practical aspects, including:
is asking for EU legislation to be passed the best way to achieve your goals?
you must first set up a group of organisers composed of at least 7 EU citizens living in seven different EU countries. To do so, you need to find people to team up with across Europe who are willing to support your issue.
how will you organise your campaign to collect the signatures?
You can find detailed advice on all these issues on the European Citizens’ Initiative Forum




Step 2: Get your initiative registered
Before you can start collecting signatures for your initiative, you must ask the Commission to register it.
For this, you will need to:
create an organiser account. You will use this to manage your initiative and liaise with the Commission throughout its lifecycle.
provide a description of your initiative in one of the official EU languages (as well as details and relevant documents on the group of organisers, funding received, etc.)
The Commission is not obliged to register all initiatives. It only registers initiatives that meet certain criteria.
Once you ask for your initiative to be registered, we will assess whether to accept it.
You will receive an answer within 2-4 months.


Step 3: Get support
You need to get the support of at least one million people, with minimum numbers in at least seven EU countries. They must fill in a specific statement of support form.
You can collect:
on paper (pre-filled forms, downloadable from your organiser account) or
online (using the Central Online Collection System).
These forms are available in all EU official languages.
To sign, people must be:
EU nationals (nationals of an EU country)
old enough to vote in European elections or aged at least 16 in some countries
TIP – It is better to collect more signatures than you need. Sometimes the authorities in each country might not be able to validate all the statements of support you provide. Throughout the collection procedure, you must comply with data protection rules.


Step 4: Submit your initiative
Once you have received the last certificate from the national authorities, you have 3 months to submit your initiative to the Commission – together with the information on the support and funding you have received for the initiative.


What next?
If the Commission considers legislation an appropriate response to your initiative, it will start preparing a formal proposal. This can require preparatory steps like public consultations, impact assessments, etc. Once adopted by the Commission, the proposal is submitted to the European Parliament and the EU Council (or in some cases, only to the Council), which will need to adopt it for it to become law.
The Commission is not obliged to propose legislation. Even where it responds positively, the most appropriate follow-up to an initiative may be non-legislative in nature. There are a range of other measures that may be more suitable.
The European Parliament may also assess the measures taken by the Commission.

Dear Wiebke,
Just a heads-up about the AGRI response to your animal welfare ISC - you will receive it later today. We can accept all of it, but we have a remaining concern about the proposed new rules for poultry cage rearing.
First, the proposed exception for farms less than 50 livestock units (3500 laying hens) does not make much sense. The overwhelming majority of eggs produced in the EU come from farms with more than 5000 birds (70 livestock units) and the smaller farms can anyway more easily transition to cage-free rearing if they haven’t done so already.
Longer transition time also does not help, it’s not about more time for farms to adapt. It’s about the money and about food prices.
For large-scale installations, cages are simply more efficient and use much less space. With your proposal, notably the requirement of more space per laying hen, production will necessarily be less cost-efficient, and most farms will not be able to keep the same number of birds. Consumers might say they care about animal welfare but when they make their choices in the supermarket, the thing that matters most is the price! If you implement the new rules, the price of eggs might increase by around 20-40% in countries like Spain, Portugal, and Malta where cage systems are still the norm. This means we will see a significant increase in cheap imported eggs from third countries with much worse animal welfare standards. Our European farmers cannot compete on such unfair terms.
There is also the socioeconomic element: the burden of higher food prices will be heavier on the poorest families.
Unless farmers can be compensated economically somehow for taking this risk, we don’t see any need for changing the current rules on poultry caging and we will need to block your proposal.

Call me if you want to discuss this further.

Best,
Michael


Attachment 8: Press release


MEPs endorse EU citizens’ call for gradual end to caged farming
Press releases – AGRI - 20 February 202X-2

The European Parliament has called for the end of caged farming within the next 5 years. The parliament members voted on an own initiative resolution recommending a total ban on the use of cages in animal agriculture by 202X+3.
The vote followed intensive lobbying by the “End the Cage Age” European Citizens Initiative, led by 170 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) across Europe, which garnered 1.4m signatures from EU citizens and demanded the phasing out of cages on farms. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted by 558 to 37 with 85 abstentions on the non-binding resolution.
Unlevel playing field in Europe
Even though the EU has banned the use of battery cages in poultry production and sow stalls during gestation, campaigners said this was not enough, given the perceived unlevel playing field across Europe with some nations already going beyond EU laws.
According to the initiative, five out of 28 countries are currently achieving more than 80% cage-free production, i.e., Austria (97%), Luxembourg (97%), Sweden (92%), Germany (86%) and the Netherlands (82%). Bottom of the list is Malta, with 1%, followed by Spain and Portugal. About sows, the report is based on Eurostat figures, according to the initiative’s website.
In the European Parliament, a working group on cage-free farming established in 202X-10 has been actively supporting the “End the Cage Age” initiative and in October 202X-3, 101 MEPs from various political parties signed a letter of support addressed to EU Commissioners.
Speeding up the review of animal welfare legislation
Last month, the parliament’s AGRI committee adopted a motion for a resolution. Committee members called on the European Commission to speed up the review of the animal welfare legislation and back the phasing out of all cages in farming, possibly already by 202X+3. They also insisted on ensuring compliance with EU standards for all products imported into the EU.
By April this year, the European Commission will have made its decision as to whether to start a legislative process to ban caged farming. EU Food Safety commissioner Stella Kyriakides told MEPs that the Commission was considering a request contained within the resolution to apply the same animal welfare standards to meat imported from outside the EU as European farmers must meet inside the bloc.
Kyriakides also noted the call for farmers to receive compensation and support in their transition from cages. She added the phase-out would happen “as soon as feasible” but did not give a specific date.
The results for pork production could be far-reaching, as it would likely change the current practice using farrowing crates. In recent years, a lot of research initiatives have already been launched to design free farrowing concepts.

Dear Ms Munoz,
Congratulations on your concluded impact assessment on the animal welfare regulation!
In view of your upcoming drafting process, I need to point out that there are several scientific studies pointing to higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, notably among e-coli bacteria, in non-cage housing systems for poultry - if not implemented correctly and with strict quality standards. I feel this did not come out clearly enough from your impact assessment.
Free-range egg production systems face more challenges related to biosecurity and use of antibiotics. The free-range layer birds have more interaction with each other compared to caged ones, leading to an increased incidence of infectious poultry diseases requiring treatment with antimicrobials, in turn leading to increased emergence of resistant commensal and pathogenic bacteria. This is a major threat to public health.
The main factor to consider is of course, as always, the number of hens per square meter, the hygiene routines, and the overall rules on veterinary prescription of antibiotics. It is the same for pigs: sows in small crates have low life quality but use less medication; pigs in free range but packed close together require lots of antibiotics and pigs in free range with sufficient space are more healthy and less prone to cause antimicrobial resistance. However, they are also much less cost-effective for industrial-size farming. 
Still, to ensure safe food production and avoid antibiotics resistance, livestock density simply must go down. 
If you could take these concerns into account in your draft revised regulation, we would be much grateful.

Best regards,
Ana Calbi

IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT


Animal welfare: revised regulation


Executive summary
To address the specific objectives of the animal welfare legislation revision, four policy measures have been considered, with low, medium, and high ambition options. Impacts assessed include cost-efficiency, environmental and societal impacts and impacts on the single market. The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) has confirmed the scientific evidence. Numerous stakeholder consultations and supporting studies have been performed.
For animals kept for economic purposes, the measures/options covered are:
1) 	Phasing out confining cages/crates for the following species and categories of animals:
Pigs
Calves
Laying hens and pullets
Rabbits and fur-producing animals.
A general transition period of between five and twelve years would be considered, depending on the level of ambition. Exceptions e.g., depending on farm size (number of “livestock units” where 1 livestock unit = 1 cow, or 2 pigs, or 71 laying hens) could be considered.
2) 	Banning the killing of day-old male chicks (or, as an alternative option, introducing an obligation of marking eggs from production systems where day-old chicks are killed). In the case of a ban, while a transition period of five years would be technically sufficient, notably if combined with stricter import rules, the impacts could be mitigated by introducing a ten years’ transition period.

3) 	Banning painful mutilations, i.e., beak trimming in poultry and tail docking in pigs (with incentives instead of bans as alternative options). For the bans, a general transition period of ten years has been considered. Incentives for voluntary action would enter into force immediately.
  
4) 	Animal welfare requirements at import. For animals and products of animal origin imported to the EU, either similar or fully equivalent animal welfare requirements with the revised EU animal welfare requirements for kept animals, as regards the use of cages, mutilations, space allowances, enrichment, the killing of day-old chicks and the welfare of fur animals would apply. A transition period of five-ten years has been considered.

A phase-out of the use of cages and stalls would considerably improve the welfare of more than 160 million laying hens, 53 million pullets (young hens), 13 million sows, two million calves, 35 million ducks and geese and 100 million rabbits. They would be able to perform a more natural and healthy behaviour.
A partial or total ban on cages and crates would have an important economic impact on the sectors concerned. For instance, for laying hens we have estimated the required investments for a transition into a cage-free system to about EUR 2,4-2,8 billion. For sows, the cost of demolishing the current system with gestation and farrowing crates could amount to around EUR 64-100 /m². These costs are likely to result in higher consumer prices. 
The situation however differs between Member States. Some have already taken measures to phase out cages and stalls whereas others have not. 
To mitigate these economic impacts, certain measures could be considered, notably awareness-raising vis-à-vis consumers, economic incentives via the Common Agricultural Policy and import rules to ensure a level playing field / reduce unfair competition.
The proposed measures would ensure a positive impact on sustainability as it would imply less intensive food production, causing less pollution to air and water. However, since cage-free animals move around more, they spend more energy and consume more feed. This could have a negative impact on the use of resources.

Table 1: Policy options (most cost-efficient option in terms of added value vs cost is shown in green):

Background
Since 202X-10, EU legislation requires that laying hens be kept either in enriched cages, or alternative systems (single or multi-tier barn or, free-range). The current legislation allows calves being individually housed until the age of eight weeks, while sows and gilts are kept in confinement for a period of four weeks after service and from one week before the expected time of farrowing to weaning of their piglets. 
Approximately one million farms keep laying hens in the EU. Forty-five percent of these are kept in enriched cages. 
There is currently a trend towards using less cages in many EU Member States such as France, the Netherlands and Poland to answer to consumer’s expectations. E.g., Austria and Luxembourg have already banned the use of cages for laying hens. The animal welfare problems related to cages will however remain for many laying hens if no action is taken at EU level.

Problem drivers
Conventional livestock production systems across EU countries are put under pressure by competitive global markets, a rise in input costs and the search for maximum profit margins by farmers and all food business operators along the production chain. The demand of certain consumers’ segments for low price food is expected to be more prevalent in the current inflationary context.
This pressure over production costs has led to further intensification (and specialisation) of the farming and killing practices, as business operators increase the volume of production to reduce overheads costs per livestock unit. Evidence shows that, while the number of livestock farms is decreasing, their size is increasing. Small farms are replaced by very large industrial scale installations.
This trend has led to certain detrimental effects on animal welfare due to high densities, certain management practices, housing/transport conditions and stunning methods, as well as due to certain breeding strategies.
Current EU rules also do not consider new scientific evidence and huge technological developments in relation to agricultural practices, zootechnics and transport operations. For instance, this new scientific evidence relates to a new understanding of stocking densities, behaviour (need for an enriched environment), mutilation practices, journey times and space allowances for animal transports, and stunning methods used for pigs, poultry, and farmed fish.
The lack of update of the EU animal welfare legislation has led Member States to adopt an increasing number of national measures going beyond EU minimum requirements to respond to the growing citizens’ concerns towards animal welfare, leading to a fragmented legal landscape, including as regards animal welfare labelling.
At the same time, consumers are growing more aware and more demanding. The upward trend of societal demands for better animal welfare protection is not reflected in the current legislative requirements. 

Figure 1: Problem tree 

Economic and environmental impacts of the preferred package of options: cages for laying hens
The policy option assessed to be most cost-efficient is a total prohibition on the use of cages for laying hens with a transition period of 5 years (from the date of entry into force of the revised legislation).
However, if no similar requirements apply for eggs and egg products imported into the EU from third countries, since the EU consumers’ demand for eggs is not expected to decrease and since EU production is expected to decrease, an increase in eggs obtained from caged hens imported from non-EU countries with lower standards is expected, thus limiting the positive animal welfare impact of the measure.
The required investments for a transition into a cage-free system for laying hens would amount to around EUR 2,4-2,8 billion.
A prohibition of cages would decrease the number of laying hens by an estimated 30% (i.e., from 186,8 million to 102,9 million) in farms which currently have cage systems.

SME’s
Small farms tend to use cage-free systems more than big farms. A prohibition would therefore primarily have a positive competitiveness impact on small farms.

Public authorities
It is likely that a prohibition would generate additional enforcement costs in the short term for the national competent authorities, however these will come back to current levels in the medium term.

Consumers
A prohibition would lead to an expected increase in the price of eggs, but to which extent is not clear. Some estimates by the EU poultry industry suggest a + 20% price gap between eggs from cages and those from barn systems. However, sales data from the Netherlands and Germany suggests a much smaller difference in prices: less than one eurocent per egg.
With an average per capita consumption of 210 eggs per year, or 4,04 eggs per week, this would mean that transitioning to cage-free systems would add less than four eurocents per person to consumers’ weekly food shopping bill. Furthermore, the experience from Germany, where enriched cages are progressively phased out, even suggests that the price for barn eggs may eventually be the same as for eggs from enriched cages.
 
Environmental impacts
A prohibition would have a positive impact on sustainability as it would imply less intensive production leading to less air and water pollution and less greenhouse gas emissions.

| A gestation crate, also known as a sow stall, is a metal enclosure in which a   used for breeding may be kept during pregnancy. A standard crate measures 2 m x 60 cm. | Sow stalls contain no bedding material and are instead floored with slatted plastic, concrete, or metal to allow waste to be efficiently collected below. This waste is then flushed into open-air pits known as . A few days before giving birth (farrowing), sows are moved to farrowing crates where they are able to lie down, with an attached crate from which their piglets can nurse. | Most pregnant sows in the US are kept in gestation crates. The crates are banned for new installations in Austria and Canada, but many sows are still confined there in pig breeding facilities. The crates are banned in the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, and Sweden. However, farrowing crates, in which female breeding pigs can be kept for up to five weeks, are not banned in the UK. | Opponents of the crates argue that they constitute animal abuse, while proponents say they are needed to prevent sows from fighting among themselves. |

Health and food safety Commissioner will fight for ethical food systems in Europe
30 October 202X-3
Earlier today, Commissioner Kyriakides met with the representatives of the citizens’ initiative ‘End the Cage Age’. EURACTIV interviewed the Commissioner after her meeting with the campaign team.
Stella Kyriakides is European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety and in charge of the EU animal welfare legislation. She spoke to EURACTIV about the call for revised animal welfare legislation and the possibility for action ahead.
This is one of the most strongly supported citizens’ initiatives so far with almost 1.4 million signatures collected. How will the Commission respond to all who signed this petition?
I am impressed by the hard work by these dedicated young people. I promised them today that the Commission will investigate this very carefully.
In fact, we recently completed a review of our legislation and have found that there is indeed scope for improvement. However, first we will hear the views of the European Parliament and we will consult across the Commission services and then reply about next steps.
Your colleague, the Commissioner for Agriculture, is less enthusiastic. How will you get the farming community onboard?
As always, there will be a balancing act between several interests. Farmers produce the food we eat and they deserve to be heard as well. Many farmers also already made this transition, showing it is possible to rear animals cage-free.
The Commission always performs a thorough impact assessment, so any legislative proposal will be based on solid facts and on careful consideration of all relevant impacts. We always seek a sustainable compromise.
There could also be other possibilities to make animal welfare more attractive for farmers by e.g., economic incentives, subsidies, trade schemes and awareness campaigns. It is not just about laws and penalties.
On the other hand, I think the farming industry has known for a long time that this is coming, they have had plenty of time to prepare and many Member States have in fact already taken significant steps in the direction of free-range animal rearing.
But is there not a risk that ‘money will talk’, how can you weigh the economic impacts against animal suffering – how will the comparison be done in an impact assessment?
No, economic interests are not the only interests we take into account. It is true that our assessment is expressed as a cost-benefit ratio, but among those ‘benefits’, we consider also softer values such as social, health and environmental impacts – and ethical choices. I guarantee you that industry interests will not dominate this process. 
On the contrary, I think what we see here is a strong message from European citizens that animal rights and animal welfare must be respected, and I agree with them. We cannot ignore this question any longer.",21,6.0,"Summary

Generally, this is a very good attempt to present a complex issue.
The introductory paragraph conveys relevant background information regarding the topic. However, the written style needs work in terms of professional fluency, and there are grammar issues that need to be ironed out. 

Also, I’m not entirely clear on the focus of the briefing from this introduction, as the disagreement of DG AGRI should be flagged from the outset. 

In the policy objective section, the key issues are set out clearly in bullet points.  However, from I. Main Issues, the briefing gives the impression of being a work-in-progress, due to its overreliance on writing in note form. Because of this, the text seems slightly disjointed and there is a lack of coherence at times. 
Furthermore, some points are not elaborated on further, analysed for their significance, or more completely argued. 
Some key details and relevant information is omitted or generalized. Providing more specifics and data on key issues will give a more comprehensive overview of the situation and lead to more informed reasoning regarding the solutions going forward. 
E.g.:
-  Could have mentioned that the impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. 
- The timing for bans were subject to being based on low, medium or high ambition options for each measure, so briefly mention what these options mean.

The suggestions given are commendable, but these need to be clearer, with recommendations given with solid reasoning as well as an exploration of consequences.

Some further grammar issues and several typos impact the readability of the document.",,"Tips to improve

Give more thought to both overall structure and paragraph structure. Think about the order of your sentences in the introduction i.e., how to construct it in terms of relaying information in a logical progression.

Briefing note
1st of June 202X
For the attention of Ms Heinrich, Director-General
Subject: Animal welfare legislative proposal
Reference: Impact assessment report on Animal welfare: revised regulation of 13 October 202X-1
Background:
Last year, the European Comission has prepared an working document of Animal welfare regulation. This year, there was an inter-service consultation with DG AGRI, DG ENV, DG TRADE on animal welfare regulation, on 16/05/202X. Conventional livestock production systems across EU countries are put under pressure by competitive global markets. The pressure to have lower prices on certain foods has led to intensification of farming with negative effect on animal welfare. The purpose of this briefing is to make more clarity towards the decision of which option to choose for the animal welfare regulation.
Policy objectives:
A. Phasing out confining cages
A general transition period needed.
B. Banning the killing of day-old male chiks
In case of a ban, a transition period need to be combined with stricter import rules. 
C. Banning paintfull mutilations
Incentives for voluntary action would enter into force imediatelly. 
D. Annimal welfare requirements at import
Similar or fully equivalent. 
I. Main issues and remaining problems to solve
1. - There is a pressure to reduce production costs, which leads to conditions and equipment they may harm the animals. 
2. - Around three hundred million farmed animals are confined in cages every year accross Europe. No single EU country is cage free.
3. - Not all the DG agree with the line of the animal welfare regulation. The current legislation is outdated, fragmented and too general. 
4. - Need to choose between ethics and prices. The impact of imposing the animal welfare regulation will lead to increase in prices. For the moment there is a lack of incentives to invest in animal welfare. A partial or total ban on cages would have an important economic impact on the sectors concerned. 
II. Arguments and facts to ease a decision - the way foreward on animal welfare regulation
DG AGRI does not yet agree with DG SANTE main line on animal welfare regulation. The number of poultry cage need to be determined or incetives to the farmers to ba established.  
Strengths
- we received confirmation from DG ENV that the proposal is in line with the European Green Deal objectives
- increase animal welfare protection
Disadvantages
- the big farmers cannot compete with cage free adoption because they would need more space, as underlines DG AGRI. This will lead to a price increase of 20-40% in countries like Spain, Portugal and Malta. 
- the European farmers will not be able to compete with third countries producers, who do not take into account animal welfare.
In conclusion
There are 3 types of options: low, medium and high. Medium and high ambition options can be combined with stricter requirements of minimum space per animal and antibiotics to be used. 
a. Following the comments received after the interservice consultation, the low ambition option or status quo should apply for protecting the market and ensure competitive pricing of food products for animal welfare. 
b. As the citizens are putting pressure through an European initiative, a decision on animal welfare should be taken asap. 
c. Regarding the poultry cage rearing, the smaller the farms, easier it is for them to implement cage free rearing.
d. The domino effect will start from animal welfare regulation - higher food prices - burden on poor families. DG AGRI proposal of incentives seem to be a solution. 
Recommendation prefered on animal welfare regulation
In conclusion there is an urge to implement as soon as possible the 'cage free' legislation for animals, accompagned by a cost/efficiency analysis. In parallel to the legislation, in order to facilitate a balanced economy, financial support and incentives may be provided through the new eco-schemes instrument of DG AGRI. Accepting the economic compensations to poultry farming will suggested by DG AGRI, will unblock our proposal on animal welfare regulation. 
The legislation should be more specific and sustanable, in accordance to the European Green Deal Objectives. Last, but not least, awarness -raising of consumers, economic incentives via the Common Agricultural Policy and import rules to ensure a level of competition. 
Therefore a mix between medium and high ambition options is preferred."

Importance:	Highest

Hi,

this morning, SESAR has unveiled its blueprint to make drone use in low-level airspace safe, secure and environmentally friendly. This “U-space” covers altitudes of up to 150 metres and will pave the way for the development of a strong and dynamic EU drone services market. The paper outlines a number of basic principles: 
Safe: safety at low altitude levels will be just as good as that for traditional manned aviation. The concept is to develop a system similar to that of Air Traffic Management for manned aviation.
Automated: the system will provide information for highly automated or autonomous drones to fly safely and avoid obstacles or collisions.
Up and running by 20XX+2: for the basic services like registration, e-identification and geo-fencing. However, further U-Space services and their corresponding standards will need to be developed in the future.
The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules that are proportionate to the risk of the operation. These rules will implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which the European Parliament and the Council (i.e. the EU Member States) are expected to adopt in the coming months.
The Commission, through the SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system.

Could you prepare a draft press release, announcing this blueprint within its wider context and send it to the Press Service by tonight?




Louis Blériot,
Head of Unit","RIGA DECLARATION
ON REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT (drones)
""FRAMING THE FUTURE OF AVIATION""

Riga - 6 March 20XX-2


Today Europe is taking a decisive step towards the future of aviation. The European aviation community gathered in Riga to exchange views on how, and under which conditions, drones can help create promising new opportunities in Europe, offering sustainable jobs and new prospects for growth both for the manufacturing industry and for future users of drones in all sectors of society. Drones offer new services and applications going beyond traditional aviation and offer the promise to perform existing services in a more affordable and environmentally friendly way. They are a truly transformational technology.

The Latvian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, European Commission representatives, Directors General of Civil Aviation of the EU Member States, data protection authorities and leaders of manufacturing industry and service providers confirmed the importance of joint European action, building on the orientations given in the EC Communication on opening the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) market. 

The aviation community stressed the necessity for European regulators to ensure that all the conditions are met for the safe and sustainable emergence of innovative drone services. At the same time regulations must help the industry to thrive and adequately deal with citizens’ concerns.
The aviation community established the following principles to guide the regulatory framework in Europe:
1. Drones need to be treated as new types of aircraft with proportionate rules based on the risk of each operation.
The provision of drone services must not be less safe than is accepted from civil aviation in general. The incremental integration of drones in the aviation system must not reduce the level of safety presently achieved in civil aviation. Although no one is on board the drone, people in other aircraft or on the ground could get hurt in case of an accident or an unscheduled landing. The way safety is regulated must be proportional to the operational risk involved.
Rules should be simple and performance based, to allow a small start-up company or individuals to start low-risk, low-altitude operations under minimal rules and to develop, with light-touch risk-based regulation, similar to the modern product safety regulations applied in other sectors. Higher risk operations would be gradually subject to more stringent regulations or operational limitations. At the other end of the spectrum, where the operational risk is highest, such as with large drones operating alongside manned aircraft, the regulation will need to be quite similar to that applying to manned aviation, with strict standards on the design, manufacturing, maintenance and operation of drones, as well as on the training of drone pilots and maintenance personnel.

2. EU rules for the safe provision of drone services need to be developed now.
Safety rules, including on remote pilot and operator qualifications, should be developed at the European level by the European Aviation Safety Agency, building on the experience developed in the EU Member States. The essential requirements should be harmonised at the global level to the maximum extent possible, and full use should be made of the established cooperation in the Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems (JARUS) and at ICAO, and should be completed by international industry standard setting bodies. Important efforts need to be put into resourcing these activities, especially JARUS, in order to ensure that the progressive risk-based approach is consistent with what is done in the rest of the world.
This basic regulatory framework should be put in place without delay, in order to help the private sector to take well-informed investment decisions, and to provide a basic set of rules for the many operators who are increasingly eager to begin providing services. The European Aviation Safety Agency should consult stakeholders by the middle of next year on the regulatory framework for the operations of drones and on concrete regulatory proposals for low-risk operations. By the end of next year the Agency will use the results of the consultation to propose a position on these matters. The proposal for the revision of the basic European Safety Regulation, which the European Commission has announced for next year, should contain the necessary new provisions and essential requirements for the progressive risk-based regulation of drones, based on the Agency's recommendations.

3. Technologies and standards need to be developed for the full integration of drones in the European airspace.
The success of drone activities and safety regulations also depends on the financial effort to develop and validate key missing technologies and the ensuing required standards. Both industry and public authorities stressed the need for adequate investment in the technologies that are required to integrate drones into the aviation system — the SESAR programme. Clean Sky and other initiatives should complete the SESAR investments. That would create spin-offbenef1ts for traditional aviation and so frame the future of ﬂying.

4. Public acceptance is key to the growth of drone services.
The respect of citizens’ fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, must be guaranteed. Many drone services involve data-gathering such as ﬁlming, etc. The responsible authorities, such as the national and European Data Protection Authorities, should develop the necessary guidelines and monitoring mechanisms to ensure the full respect of existing protection rules, including in relation to drones. Rules need to clarify what is acceptable and what is not, and they require to be properly enforced.
Drones may cause nuisances and negative externalities, such as noise. These nuisances need to be addressed, possibly at the local level, to maintain public acceptance.
Drones also pose potential security risks. The design of drones can and should take into account those risks by using methods such as cyber-defence or geofencing. However, the malicious use of drones cannot be entirely prevented by design or operational restrictions. It is the task of the national police and justice systems to address those risks.
5. The operator of a drone is responsible for its use.
When a drone service is delivered in prohibited airspace, in an unsafe manner, or for illegal purposes, the authorities should be able to act and hold the operator accountable. Where lacking, this will need to be clarified in national law. Moreover, in order to enforce responsibility, it will be necessary for drones to have at all times an identiﬁable owner or operator. The regulator should seek the least bureaucratic way to achieve this. For instance, the mandating of electronic identity chips on drones - “IDrones” - as is today envisaged in some states, could be formalised through a safety rule, which would contribute to the effective implementation of privacy and security requirements. Standardised web-portals in the Member States for the registration of operators and their operations could be another solution. The involved authorities need to work closely together.
Drone accidents will happen. Member States should clarify the applicable insurance and third party liability regime and monitor the compensation mechanisms for potential victims. The establishment of compensation funds to cover victims of accidents caused by uninsured drone users, as used in the motor insurance sector, could be envisaged. Reporting on drone incidents should be integrated into the overall incident reporting requirements. Systematic and coherent incident reporting will improve safety and will be instrumental for insurance companies in their risk analysis on which third party liability insurance premiums are based.
To allow a short reaction time, the development of drone services and drone technologies needs close monitoring. To this end, the EU should establish an easy access for SMEs to information required for drone manufacturing and service provision, together with an observatory to keep track of the growing number of operations in Europe and the evolution of innovation. This monitoring will permit informed decisions relative to the establishment of priorities for future legislation. It will also help regulators to learn from experience and verify that the rules are fit for purpose, namely to ensure that new technologies and drone services can develop in full respect of the required high levels of safety, security, privacy and environmental protection. An annual progress report should be published.
The European aviation community gathered in Riga today is committed to working together on the basis of these principles to allow businesses to provide drone services everywhere in Europe as from 20XX-1 onwards.



Introduction
The demand for drone services is steadily increasing, with the potential to generate significant economic growth and societal benefits, as recognised in the 20XX-2 EU Aviation Strategy, and more recently in the SESAR Drones Outlook Study and Warsaw Declaration on drones. In order to realise this potential, the Declaration calls for “urgent action on the airspace dimension, in particular the development of the concept of U-space”. Ultimately, U-space will enable complex drone operations with a high degree of automation to take place in all types of operational environments, including urban areas. U-space must be flexible enough to encourage innovation, support the development of new businesses and facilitate the overall growth of the European drone services market while properly addressing, at EU level, safety and security issues, respecting the privacy of citizens, and minimising the environmental impact. This blueprint outlines the proposed vision for U-space and how it could be rolled out. Rather than providing a definitive solution, this blueprint provides the basis to better define the way drones will operate in Europe in the future. 
What is U-space?
U-space is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for large numbers of drones. These services rely on a high level of digitalisation and automation of functions, whether they are on board the drone itself, or are part of the ground-based environment. U-space provides an enabling framework to support routine drone operations, as well as a clear and effective interface to manned aviation.

What are the key principles of U-space?
The delivery of U-space relies upon the following key principles:
To ensure the safety of all airspace users operating in the U-space framework, as well as people on the ground.
To provide a scalable, flexible and adaptable system that can respond to changes in demand, volume, technology, business models and applications, while managing the interface with manned aviation.
To enable high-density operations with multiple automated drones under the supervision of fleet operators.
To guarantee equitable and fair access to airspace for all users.
To enable competitive and cost-effective service provision at all times, supporting the business models of drone operators.
To minimise deployment and operating costs by leveraging, as much as possible, existing aeronautical services and infrastructure, including GNSS as well as those from other sectors, such as mobile communication services.
To accelerate deployment by adopting technologies and standards from other sectors where they meet the needs of U-space.
To follow a risk-based and performance-driven approach when setting up appropriate requirements for safety, security [including cyber-security] and resilience [including failure mode management], while minimising environmental impact and respecting the privacy of citizens, including data protection.


How will U-space operate?
Subject to compliance with applicable regulations, operational limitations and technical requirements linked to the operation of the drone, U-space facilitates any kind of mission, from the delivery of goods, aerial work, and search and rescue, to more complex future applications such as urban air mobility.
U-space services are offered to both private [leisure and professional] and public users of drones, for all types of missions. Some services will meet privacy and security needs expressed by the relevant authorities. In addition, the criticality of these services will lead to the establishment of performance requirements for both structural elements and service delivery, covering, for example, safety, security, availability, continuity and resilience.
The U-space framework comprises an extensive and scalable range of services relying on agreed EU standards and delivered by service providers. These services do not replicate the function of ATC ‚ as known in ATM, but deliver key services to organise the safe and efficient operation of drones and ensure a proper interface with manned aviation, ATC and relevant authorities. They may include the provision of data, supporting services for drone operators such as flight planning assistance and more structured services such as tracking or capacity management.



Unmanned aircraft (most people call them ‘drones’) is a sector of aviation that is developing very fast and has a great potential for producing new jobs and growth. The term ‘unmanned aircraft’ includes very large aircraft similar in size and complexity to manned aircraft, but also very small consumer electronics aircraft. Especially the smaller ones are increasingly being used in the Europe Union (EU), but under a fragmented regulatory framework. Basic national safety rules apply, but the rules differ across the EU and a number of key safeguards are not addressed in a coherent way.
On request by the European Commission, Member States and other stakeholders, the Agency started to develop a proposals for an operation centric, proportionate, risk- and performance-based regulatory framework for all unmanned aircraft (UA) establishing three categories with different safety requirements, proportionate to the risk:
‘open’ (low risk) is a UA operation category that, considering the risks involved, does not require a prior authorisation by the competent authority before the operation takes place;
‘specific’ (medium risk) is a UA operation category that, considering the risks involved, requires an authorisation by the competent authority before the operation takes place and takes into account the mitigation measures identified in an operational risk assessment, except for certain standard scenarios where a declaration by the operator is sufficient;
‘certified’ (high risk) is a UA operation category that, considering the risks involved, requires the certification of the UA, a licensed remote pilot and an operator approved by the competent authority, in order to ensure an appropriate level of safety.
Following the publication of an advance NPA, a Technical Opinion, a ‘Prototype’ regulation was drafted for the ‘open’ and ‘specific’ categories. The ‘Prototype’ regulation was published proposing actual rules providing the necessary clarity, notably on what are the responsibilities of the Member States and what is the flexibility offered to them.
A significant number of comments has been received and together with the significant inputs provided by an expert group have been taken into account to further develop the regulation text leading to the publication of an NPA. An impact assessment details analysis of several potential options considered. The analysis benefited also from feedback provided by stakeholders.
The NPA has taken into consideration the developments in the international arena e.g. work done in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO); in the Joint Authorities for the Rulemaking of Unmanned Systems (JARUS) and of course in the USA (Federal Aviation Administration- FAA).
The proposal provides a framework to safely operate drones while allowing this industry to remain agile, to innovate and continue to grow. The risk posed to people on the ground and to other aircraft as well as privacy, security and data protection issues created by such drones are also taken into account.
The proposed regulation defines the technical and operational requirements for the drones. Technical requirements refer for example to the remote identification of drones.  Operational requirements refer among others to geofencing; a system that ensures the drones does not enter a prohibited zone. The proposal also addresses the pilots’ qualifications. Furthermore, drone operators will have to register themselves, except when they operate drones lighter than 250g.
This proposal is breaking new grounds by combining Product legislation and Aviation legislation. Indeed, design requirements for small drones will be implemented by using the legislation relative to making products available on the market (the well-known CE marking). The standard CE mark will be accompanied by the identification of the class of the drone (from C0 to C4) and by a do’s and don’ts leaflet that will be found in all drone boxes. Based on the drone class an operator will know in which area he can operate and what competence is required.
The proposal allows a high degree of flexibility for EASA Member States; they will be able to define zones in their territory where either drones operations are prohibited or restricted (for example to protect sensitive areas), or where certain requirements are alleviated.
For operations that pose higher risks, an operational risk assessment will define the requirements that the operator needs to comply before flying the drone.
The proposal also provides special alleviations for people flying model aircraft - which are also drones – to recognise the good safety records in aero modelling identifying 3 options:
Member States may issue a special authorisation to model clubs and associations defining deviations from the UAS regulation;
Operations can be conducted in specific zones designated by Member States; or
Operations can be conducted in the open category according the operational limitations defined for one of the Subcategory (A3)
EASA will submit a final Opinion to the European Commission at the end of 20XX, which will take into account the feedback, received to this proposal.

Secure your drone – or pay the price 
By Nick Gibbons - cyber security expert and partner at BLM
Drone technology offers many benefits – from the potential for speedy Amazon deliveries from the sky, to saving lives, as witnessed recently when the Lochaber mountain rescue team used one to find a hurt climber. 
But on the flip side, there are risks associated with aerial technology, such as drone jacking or hacking. 
Typically, when the conversation moves to the subject of drone-jacking, people immediately envisage a Hollywood-style breach of national security, probably in or around the White House before Will Smith leaps in to save the day. 
However, attacks on this technology represent very real risks for the growing number of businesses using drones, such as engineers surveying buildings and infrastructure, e-commerce giants sending deliveries or companies gathering surveillance for insurance claims. 
Earlier this year, Amazon announced an expansion to its research and development team in Cambridge. This will see 400 technology specialists fine-tuning the technology behind delivery drones. Despite claims that such deliveries are “pipe dreams”, there is a growing market for commercial drone technology, and with this comes a growing risk of drone-jacking. 
Last November, a report from security software company McAfee predicted cybercriminals will soon turn their attention to targeting drones, particularly those used for law enforcement, filming and deliveries. 
Drones without adequate security in place will be vulnerable to hacks, as well as physical attacks. The report speculates 20XX will see an increase in availability, via the dark web, of pre-packaged software and toolkits for hacking drones. In these cases, hacking of the drone itself or its supporting software may result in either physical misuse or data breaches. Hacking for the physical diversion of a drone carries the potential for personal injury or property damage, actual theft of the drone or indeed, the item it was carrying. 
Theft of data is another real risk, particularly if the drone contains personal or sensitive information, whether customer data included for delivery purposes or footage collected via an attached camera. 
The loss of data via drone-jacking leaves businesses and authorities with many privacy concerns, especially with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into force in May 20XX+1. In recent years, there have been a raft of data breaches resulting in an invasion of privacy for customers of companies, including TalkTalk and Camelot, and breaches of the GDPR could entail fines of up to four per cent of a company’s global turnover. 
Attacks are becoming more sophisticated and wide-reaching; recently, we saw the extensive damage hackers can unleash with the WannaCry cyber attack bringing organisations across the globe to a standstill. 
If cyber attacks start targeting drones, drone-jacking could leave businesses and their customers equally exposed with regards to personal and commercial data, and the prospect of big fines levied by the Information Commissioner’s Office. 
Although the use of drones is already, to an extent, covered by a range of laws and regulations, including the Data Protection Act, more specific, targeted legislation is necessary, as are effective insurance products for organisations using drones. This is especially important with the European Commission predicting full integration of drones into European airspace by 20XX+10. 
The UK Government is clearly live to the emerging risks of drone technology. Following a recent consultation exercise, a registration system is to be launched for drones weighing 250g or more. The UK Government is considering the best legislative option for introducing the new rules. 
Currently, a combination of existing insurance policies are required to cover risks associated with drone technology. As the risk of electronic theft of sensitive data rises, the market for specialised policies grows. 
In the case of drone-jacking, it would be wise for a business to consider cyber risk policies available for first and third parties. These can provide protection against business interruption, reputational risks, loss or theft of third party corporate data notification expenses and the payment of compensation to individuals affected by security or privacy breaches. Care should be taken, however, when selecting a particular cyber policy, including detailed discussions with a specialised brokers. 
So while drones have life-saving potential for Scotland’s mountain rescue teams and a business may find investing in the technology an attractive proposition, an outbreak of drone-jacking could be hugely costly. It is critical that companies consider the security breaches drone-jacking could leave them open to, and invest in the appropriate protection – just in case Will Smith is not available. 



Drone flew 'within wingspan' of plane approaching Heathrow 
Rob Davies
A drone flew within 20 metres of a plane on the approach to Heathrow, while another shocked pilots by appearing at 3,000 metres (10,000ft), a monthly update on near-misses has revealed.
Commercial jet pilots reported two “category A” incidents, the most serious class of near-miss, involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), known as drones.
The latest report comes amid concern that drone near-misses are on the rise, potentially posing a threat to recreational and commercial planes.
In one case, an Airbus A320 pilot on the approach to Heathrow in October last year spotted a drone within just 20 metres, or “possibly within the wingspan” of the aircraft.
Investigators concluded that the drone had flown so close to the passenger jet that “providence had played a major part in the aircraft not colliding”. They also noted that the “blue and disc-like” craft appeared to be custom-made, rather than a commercially available model.
In the second of two serious UAV incidents, an A320 pilot taking off from Heathrow saw a red drone overhead, about 50 metres away from his right wing at about 1,000 metres.
The pilot noted that there would have been a “distinct possibility of damage” had a collision occurred, while investigators found that “a collision had only been narrowly avoided and chance had played a major part”.
A third drone sighting, deemed a less serious category B incident, involved an unmanned aircraft at an altitude that surprised pilots, who had “no time to react”.
The UK Airprox Board, which issues monthly reports on the threat of mid-air collisions, reported a pilot saying: “Was that a drone? At 10,000 ft!”
Large drones are not permitted to fly above 120 metres, or close to airports.
The “large drone”, which appeared to be stationary, came within 60 metres (200ft) of the aircraft, a distance deemed less risky than the category A incidents, but nonetheless “a situation where safety was not assured”.
A fourth drone sighting, involving a pilot on a sightseeing trip near the Binevenagh mountain in Northern Ireland, was deemed to be at the lowest level of risk, category E.
In all four cases, police were alerted but the operator of the drone could not be traced.
Ministers are considering measures to enforce registration of all new drones so they can be better monitored, while the Department for Transport is also reviewing drone safety.
Pilots believe a collision with an airliner could be catastrophic and that the impact of a drone strike on a light plane or helicopter would almost certainly bring it down.
The British Airline Pilots Association has warned that the number of incidents could soar as people fly drones received as Christmas presents, often with little or no handling experience or understanding of the rules.
There have been 59 drone near-misses reported in the past 12 months. Drone sightings were among 21 incidents reported to the UK Airprox Board, six of which were deemed to be in the most serious category.
Among the other category A incidents was a near-miss in which a model aircraft was flown close to a Chinook military helicopter coming in to land at RAF Benson.





European Commission demands EU laws on drones after string of near-misses with aeroplanes
, Brussels correspondent 
30 September 20XX-1 • 8:20am 
The European Commission has called for fresh impetus behind its stalled plans for EU-wide regulation of drones, after a string of near-misses with airplanes across Europe last year.
There were more than 1,200 “safety occurrences"" involving drones in Europe last year, including several involving planes, the commission, the EU’s civil service, said.
On April 22, a drone passed by the wingtip of  with 156 passengers as it came into land at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. In 2016 three planes narrowly missed drones near Heathrow airport,  for tougher .
“If we don't move fast enough, the near misses between drones and airplanes could one day have disastrous consequences,” Violeta Bulc, the EU’s transport commissioner said.
“Drones offer tremendous opportunities for new services and businesses,” she said, “but safety always comes first”.
The commission drafts laws, which are then amended separately by the European Parliament and national governments sitting in the Council of Ministers. A bill can only enter into force across the EU when an identical text is agreed by MEPs and the council. 



North Wales Police use drones to fight crime
10 January 20XX
North Wales Police has become the latest force in Wales to use drones to help in the fight against crime.
Fifteen officers and staff have been trained to use the unmanned aircraft to capture video and images to be used in investigations. 
This includes searching for missing people as well as gathering evidence from road traffic investigations and major crime incidents.
Drone were used to investigate a .
The team's two drones, which can also carry a thermal imaging camera, have already been used to search for missing people and investigate incidents during a trial last year.
Insp Craig Jones from the force's operational planning unit said they were highly effective in gathering images over difficult terrain or hard to reach areas and helped officers gain information, quickly and safely.
The live images they take can be seen by police on the ground and they were recently used to help firefighters tackle a large blaze at the Gateway to Wales Hotel.
Stuart Millington, of North Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said the ability to see aerial moving images that show fire hotspots was a ""significantly useful tool"" in ongoing incidents.
An agreement with the force means the fire service can call on the police drone pilots to help them deal with incidents when needed.
North Wales Police's Deputy Chief Constable Gareth Pritchard added the drones were a highly cost effective tool in fighting crime and helping communities.
""Being able to launch a drone in the air in a few minutes could help save lives and secure vital evidence if a crime was in progress,"" he said.

 



Drone makers zero in on commercial opportunities

Louise Lucas in Hong Kong July 5, 20XX-1
They have been used to shoot weddings, Hollywood movies and terrorists. But now drones, and their makers, are navigating a third path between hobbyists and warfare into the industrial world, threatening a shake-up of the burgeoning $6bn industry. 
New uses for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to give drones their technical name, are emerging almost daily: delivering packages, pizzas and blood; surveying mines; pre-emptive firefighting; even collecting whale snot to help conserve the mammals. 
“We are developing the UAV into a means of production,” said Paul Xu, vice-president of DJI, at a conference in Shenzhen last month. His company has given China undisputed leadership in the sector, with its 70 per cent market share of non-military drones 
However, if Shenzhen-based DJI, valued at $8bn-$10bn at its last funding round in 20XX-2, is to keep that lead, it will need to adapt to new market dynamics. 
The industry dismisses talk of “peak” consumer drone, but few expect that part of the business to maintain its heady growth rates. Outside China, casualties abound: in California, Lily Robotics shut up shop in January, while 3D Robotics switched its focus to software and Parrot, of France, axed jobs. New entrants are cut from an altogether different cloth, with industrial and tech groups, including Qualcomm, Intel and Boeing hovering over the space. 
Regulators too are braced for change, as the industry lobbies for more openings. In a first step, the US Federal Aviation Administration, in effect, opened the skies to commercial drones a year ago, with limited safety rules covering the sector. 
Since the FAA rule changes, says Michael Perry, director of strategic partnerships at DJI, the enterprise industry has been scaling up rapidly, encouraged by the more certain regulatory environment. “Before we had conversations [with businesses] but then they said: ‘How will my legal team deal with this?’ The last thing we want is vagaries. People won’t invest if they aren’t sure.” 
DJI, the creation of Frank Wang, a radio-controlled helicopter enthusiast from Hangzhou who transformed his boyhood hobby into a company with sales of $1.5bn, is now looking into areas ranging from agriculture to eliminating mosquitoes. 
“Personal drone vendors are now aggressively trying to position themselves in the commercial market,” says Gerald Van Hoy, senior research analyst at Gartner, although the firm says the 3m drones it expects to be shipped this year will still be overwhelmingly for the consumer market. These figures are up 39 per cent on 20XX-1 and should translate into revenues of $6bn.",8,7.0,"Summary

INTERNAL NOTE (DG Mobility and Transport)
This internal note aims at assisting the press office to prepare a press release announcing the publication, by the Single Europeas Sky Air traffic management Research (SESAR) Joint Undertaking, of its blueprint for drone use in low-level air space. The publication of this blueprint, following a request of the Commission, is part of the Commission's Aviation Strategy, which requires an effective legal framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of concerns, notably safety.
The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States (MS) and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules in order to implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which is expected to be adopted in the coming months.
Within this context, the Commission, through SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system.
This note will first highlight the opportunities and threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace (1) and it will then turn to the blueprint for drone use in low-level air space (2).
1. Opportunities and threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace
1.1. Opportunities of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace
- Employement and growth:
According to the European Air Safety Agency (EASA), unmanned aircraft has great potential for producing new jobs and growth.
- New or better services:
In its Riga Declaration ""Framing the future of aviation"", the European aviation community further advocates that drones offer new services and applications going beyond traditional aviation and offer the promise to perform existing services in a more affordable and environmetal friedly way.
This aspect was also hightlighted in the press, where several potential benefits of drones have been put forward, from Amazon deliveries to rescue missions and fight against crime.
1.2. Threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace:
- Safety:
Some concerns have been raised in the press that ""saferty occurences"" involving drones in Europe are on the rise, potentially posing a threat to recreational and commercial planes. Similar concerns have been raised by the European aviation community, which stated, in its recent Rega Declaration, that, althoigh no one is on board of a drone, people in other aicraft or on the ground could get hurt in case of an accident or an unscheduled landing.
- Noise:
The European aviation community also identified other risks linked to the use of drones, such as nuisances and negatice externalities.
- Right to privacy:
In its recent Riga Declaration, the European aviation community also raised concerns with respect to the protection of fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, as many drones involve data-gathering such as filming.
- Security threats:
Another risk which has been put forward is the potential security risk linked to the malicious use of drones.
It can thus be said that the use of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace both has a lot of potential to foster European leadership and competitiveness, but also implied important risks that need to be mitigated through an effective legal framework.
2. The blueprint for drone use in low-level air space
The purpose of this blueprint is to make drone use in low-level airspace safe, secure and environmentallu friendly. It will pave the way for the development of a strong and dynamic EU drone services market.
This blueprint oulines the proposed vision for the concept of ""U-space"", which is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace (altitudes of up to 150 meters) for large number of drones.
This paper outiles a number of basic principles:
i) Safety at low level altitude levels:
The concept is to develop a system similar to that of Air Traffic Management (ATM) for manned aviation.
ii) Automated system:
The system will provide information for highly automated or autonomous drones to fly safely and avoid obstacles or collisions.
iii) Partly up and running by 20XX+2:
It will be the case for basic services like registration, e-identification and geo-fencing."

EMAIL 1","Subject: Towards a sustainable, circular, European battery supply chain 
Dear YOU,

In December 20XX-2, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on batteries and waste batteries. The proposal aims to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery life cycle. The initiative is closely linked to the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the New Industrial Strategy. 
At the end of last year, The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. For the first time the legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of a battery – from the supply chain of raw materials, over the production to reuse and recycling of batteries – and ensure that they are safe, sustainable, and competitive.
As you know, our unit has the lead on this important file and our DG intends to launch the formal interservice consultation over the coming weeks. Before this, our DG wants to organize an internal reflection and brainstorming meeting, and I have been appointed to chair this meeting.
Could you produce an internal memo, summarizing the main ins and outs of this file and the agenda for the internal meeting with concrete proposals and recommendations to fine-tune the original proposal, in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators. 
I’m on mission tomorrow so please could you get this done for me today. It doesn’t need to be long – in fact the shorter, the better.  

Many thanks",",

Europe will soon release its Critical Raw Materials Act to identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk.
Europe’s green energy transition plans give a central role to the electrification of transportation. 
The European Union (EU) has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Recently proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035.
In 20XX-2, electric car registrations for the year were close to 1,729,000, up from 1,061,000 in 2020, with prospects for the region remaining positive. Last year, the market share of battery electric cars almost doubled to around 10 percent, but challenges faced by carmakers continue to weigh on demand as inflation and fears of a recession put pressure on targets. 
In its most recent forecast, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) said it expects the overall EU car market to shrink again this year, slipping by 1 percent to reach 9.6 million units.
“To ensure a return to growth — with an even greater share of electric vehicle sales so climate targets can be met — we urgently need the right framework conditions to be put in place,” said Oliver Zipse, ACEA president and CEO of BMW. “These include greater resilience in Europe’s supply chains, an EU Critical Raw Materials Act that ensures strategic access to the raw materials needed for e-mobility, and an accelerated roll-out of charging infrastructure.”
As sales of electric vehicles increase, carmakers are looking to secure supply of key metals used in batteries, including lithium. Today, Europe is quite dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply and China for lithium refining, but the region is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for the important battery metal. 
What is the European Critical Raw Materials Act? 
In September, news broke that Europe will be putting forward the European Critical Raw Materials Act, a new piece of legislation. Its aim is to identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc has learned its lesson about the risks of being dependent on Russia, and realizes the need to be vigilant toward China.
""In the case of China, it is the risk of dependency on technologies and raw materials,"" she said, adding that the EU needs to boost its production capacity and shift more towards trustworthy suppliers.
In October, von der Leyen said the EU is witnessing quite an acceleration of trends and tensions with China. 
""The Chinese system is fundamentally different from ours and we are aware of the nature of the rivalry,'' she said.
The moves from the EU are in line with pushes seen in other regions such as North America, where the US has committed billions of dollars to reach its carbon emissions targets.
In June, the Biden administration launched the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate incentives. The legislation, which was signed into law in August, requires automakers to source 50 percent of critical minerals used in electric vehicle batteries from North America or free trade agreement countries by 2024, with that amount rising to 80 percent by the end of 20XX+3.
For its part, Canada recently ordered three Chinese companies to divest from lithium companies following a “multi-step national security review process.” China has opposed the move, and Canada is expected to release its China strategy soon.
Europe-Asia relationship in the lithium space 
Jack Bedder of Project Blue said Asia will always be a part of the European lithium-ion battery supply chain. Major Asian companies, including Panasonic, Samsung, BYD Company and CATL, all have operating capacity on the continent.
“As a result, it will be almost impossible to detach fully from Chinese-owned supply across all stages of the lithium-ion supply chain,” he told the Investing News Network.
However, as lithium processing capacity is built up globally at non-Chinese-owned companies, particularly within the EU, the opportunities to reduce the EU's dependency on China-owned supply will improve. “It is very unlikely that the EU will implement legislation directly prohibiting lithium supply from Chinese-owned companies, as further constraints on supply availability to the European market will only hinder growth in the industry over the coming decade,” Bedder added.
For Allan Pedersen of Wood Mackenzie, Europe cannot move forward without influence from Asia in the short to medium term.
That’s due to a few reasons. As mentioned, many of the battery plants being constructed in Europe have Asian companies behind them, and the cathodes needed in batteries are still largely produced in Asia, where the know-how is strongest. Additionally, lithium refining is mainly done in China and most mineral concentrate is produced in Australia.
“China has a multi-year advantage over the rest of the world in terms of investing in the entire supply chain — it will be challenging for Europe to catch up to that in terms of investment in know-how, processing equipment and resources,” he said. 
“This doesn’t mean that Europe cannot make progress in this space. In lithium, we see some resource developments and processing facilities being considered and constructed.”
For the analyst, in the long-term Europe has the potential to become more self-sufficient for raw materials as recycling becomes a larger part of the supply landscape and can supplement domestic resources.
European Commission could classify lithium as toxic. 
Although Europe is pushing to build a resilient supply chain by partnering with allies and developing domestic resources, it might not all be good news for miners in the region — at the end of last year, the European Commission said it will weigh a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride and hydroxide as dangerous for human health.
If the proposal is approved, this could undermine the EU’s attempt to create and support a domestic battery materials supply chain, research firm Rystad Energy said in a statement. “The EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium to supply its nascent electric vehicle production sector and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions, at a time when the union is focused on energy security and reducing emissions,” the document reads.
If the classification goes ahead, it would not stop lithium usage, but it is highly likely to have an impact on at least four stages: lithium mining, processing, cathode production and recycling.
“This potential ruling comes at a time when the EU is itself scrambling to build and establish local lithium supply chains. The permitting issue has repeatedly been highlighted at recent industry events as one of the main barriers to new mining projects ramping up quickly in the EU,” according to Rystad Energy analysts. “There is also further risk of potential projects losing local community support for building lithium mines and processing operations.”

Lithium salts could be declared health hazard in EU
June 9, 20XX-1 by Igor Todorović


A major lithium producer threatened to close its plant in Germany if the European Union declares the material dangerous to human health. The European Chemicals Agency or ECHA initiated the process.
The European Union has been making its environmental and climate rules stricter for decades. The administration in Brussels wants to make the entire continent carbon neutral by mid-century. At the same time, it is striving to achieve the highest level of protection from pollution in the world.
The energy transition and the decarbonization of industrial activity and power plants imply massive deployment of renewables, mostly solar and wind farms. However, as they depend on unstable weather conditions, the electric power system requires energy storage, in which the EU counts a lot on batteries.
Dangerous critical raw material
Lithium-ion solutions still dominate the sector, though there are other technologies emerging that could popularize less harmful material for home units and the batteries for electronic devices, electric vehicles, and utility systems. At the same time, the European Commission is struggling to secure supply chains that would make the availability of lithium stable and make the EU almost self-sufficient by 20XX+7.
The European Union has added lithium to a list of critical raw materials as demand is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years.
Initiatives to open mines and ore processing plants such as the ones in Serbia and Portugal have caused a public uproar as environmentalists and the local population are fearful about the impact on nature and people’s livelihoods. In other projects, engineers are trying to make the extraction of lithium from geothermal waters cost effective and harmless, without any mining.
Stricter rules for handling lithium would lift costs
However, the entire concept could falter with the European Commission’s upcoming legislation. Namely, it is considering the proposal from the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA, to declare key lithium salts hazardous for human health, Reuters reported. If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, and handling of the materials.
ECHA’s Risk Assessment Committee accepted the demand from France in September to classify lithium salts as damaging for fertility and unborn children and to declare the substances harmful for breastfed children.
Adding lithium salts to the list of materials hazardous for health may prompt the revision of a range of projects in the industry.
Stricter rules mean higher costs, so any lithium ore processing plant project, like the one in the Jadar area in Serbia, would need to be given a second look regarding its environmental impact and feasibility.
Albemarle, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has indicated it may be forced to close its plant in Langelsheim in north Germany if the plan is accepted. In that case, Chief Financial Officer Scott Tozier said, the company wouldn’t be able to import lithium chloride, its primary feedstock.
The unit’s annual revenue is USD 500 million, and the plant has over 600 employees. Tozier warned a decision to declare lithium salts hazardous would prompt an exodus of EU producers including battery recyclers.
The decision is expected to be reached by early next year, the article adds.





The Really Big Battery Deal in the IRA That People Are Missing
By Zachary Shahan – Published September 23, 20XX-1
When it comes to electric vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, almost all the discussion has been around the consumer tax credit for buying an electric vehicle, including the interesting new battery aspects of that. That’s a big topic, but there’s a whole other battery angle separate from the consumer tax credit, and it’s huge.
The short summary of the whole thing is that the IRA incentives for nearly every stage of battery production and the battery supply chain are very attractive, and since they stack on top of each other, the IRA is likely to stimulate a “gold rush” of sorts in battery mineral mining, battery mineral refining, battery cell production, battery recycling, and battery pack production in the United States. When you also consider that consumers will need to get batteries whose components don’t come from China, and that come from North America eventually, then it’s essentially a given that everyone in the industry now knows it should have battery mineral mining and refining as well as battery cell and pack production in North America.

The Current EV Battery Mineral Situation
First, let’s note where we’re starting from. The USA currently mines and refines close to 0% of the minerals that go into EV battery packs. China, on the other hands, mines or refines the majority of all the big ones, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. Here’s a chart on Chinese EV battery mineral domination:

Money, Money, Money
Looking at the data, the idea that Joe Biden was going to stimulate a gold rush in the EV battery mineral mining and refining space was a dream some of us had, but it seemed like one of the more outlandish dreams we could have in this time and age. However, the market does respond to three things pretty well: money, money, money, and money. And the Biden administration, Prime Minister Manchin, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and others involved in crafting the legislation took note and decided to offer all four.
The slight joke here, aimed at emphasizing the key point, is that the IRA seems to be offering cash money (tax credits) for mining battery minerals, for refining battery minerals, for putting together battery cells, and for putting together battery packs (or “modules”). If you do all those things, you don’t get one bonus, you get four bonuses. If you count all the different minerals in a battery, the number of potential bonuses is much larger. Those bonuses add up, and they make it much more appealing to bring full-cycle battery production to the USA. At the very least, it should open mining and refining projects — which are more or less non-existent in the United States — by making them much more bankable. (Side note: Canadian and Mexican locations hoping to attract battery manufacturing investment may not have figured it out yet, but their competitive position versus the US took a major hit when Biden signed the IRA.)
That’s why we recently got news of Tesla reportedly deciding to scrap some investments it had already made in Germany (but not all of them) and move some battery cell production stateside. That’s why Tesla is reportedly exploring lithium refining in Texas now as well. That’s why GM is reportedly accelerating its exploration of EV battery mineral supplies from US soil. “Our thought process was that we would do this over a period of time, but with the IRA, we are actively working on figuring out how to accelerate,” said Sham Kunjur, GM’s executive director for EV raw materials. But this is only the beginning. These are just the leaks from early movers and leaky groups. Whether it’s Tesla, GM, Volkswagen, Ford, Panasonic, SK Innovation, LG Energy Solution (previously known as LG Chem), Samsung SDI, Albemarle, Livent, Piedmont Lithium, Talon Metals, Lithium Americas, Pilbara Minerals, or others, corporate teams are looking at the IRA, having their lawyers look at it, and starting to look much more seriously at what production opportunities they can launch in the United States.
Looking at the Actual IRA Language
Section 45X of the IRA concerns “components produced and sold after December 31, 2022.” Near the beginning, it states that “any taxable year is an amount equal to the sum of the credit amounts determined under subsection (b) with respect to each eligible component.” In other words, if you get a tax credit for one component of a battery (raw lithium, for example), you can also go and get a tax credit for another component or even later stage of the same component (the refined lithium, for example). The tax credits are for each major stage of the production process, and that means you can get them for various components of a battery and various stages of processing or putting together those components. You can get the following credits:
10% of the cost of battery electrode active materials
$35/kWh of battery cell capacity
$10/kW of battery module capacity (or, for a battery module that does not use battery cells, $45/kWh)
10% of the cost of producing a battery mineral.
Also, while there’s a phaseout for some of these between 2030 and 2032, there is no phaseout at all for the critical mineral subsidies! That’s long-term stability for a market that needs it.
What Minerals & Battery Components Are Eligible?
Regarding electrode active materials, those include “cathode materials, anode materials, anode foils, and electrochemically active materials, including solvents, additives, and electrolyte salts that contribute to the electrochemical processes necessary for energy storage.”
Applicable critical minerals include aluminum/alumina, antimony/antimony trisulfide concentrate, barite/barium sulfate, beryllium/copper-beryllium master alloy, cerium/cerium oxide, cesium/cesium formate/cesium carbonate, chromium/ferrochromium, cobalt/cobalt sulfate, graphite/graphitic carbon, lithium/lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, manganese, nickel/nickel sulphate, and many others.
Notably, at the end, it’s noted that only production that takes place in the United States is eligible for these tax credits. This creates a “USA premium” in the supply of raw materials to facilities that want to get the maximum benefit from 45X. Any manufacturer will be eligible for a 45X tax credit which covers the yearly cost of production if their facility is using raw material from the US. For most manufacturing, raw material cost is the most significant component of OPEX after labor and energy. So, Biden, Schumer, Manchin, and their aides have been very clever here: “want the maximum benefit, Buy American.”
So, let’s go back to the example of Tesla (or you can use Ford, GM, or some other company in this hypothetical if you prefer). Tesla could, theoretically, get a tax credit for mining lithium, get a tax credit for refining lithium, get a tax credit for mining nickel, get a tax credit for refining nickel, get a tax credit for producing battery anodes, get a tax credit for producing battery cells, and get a tax credit for producing battery modules. Of course, Tesla isn’t going to do all those things. However, I think that helps to explain the potential here. Whereas Tesla won’t do all those things itself, companies and investors will be pouring into the United States to do them, and some automakers will deepen their vertical integration in the battery space as well.
As a final note, and perhaps as a teaser for something we’ll come back to, while the incentives from the IRA are attractive, so is the potential for pricing control over raw materials! Whether Ford, GM, or Tesla, having more secure, stable, predictable control over key raw material costs could go a long way in being competitive and financially sustainable in the coming decade. How much is that pricing control worth as we go from ~5% EV market share in the US auto industry to 50% or more?

Russia may launch lithium production in the coming four years
June 17, 20XX-1
| As said at the SPIEF Oleg Kazanov, Director of the All-Russian Institute of Mineral Resources (VIMS) under Federal Subsoil Resources Management Agency, Russia may start lithium mining based on the ore deposits in the Murmansk region in 3-4 years and become one of the world’s five largest producers in eight years’ time.  |  |
“Russia has a lithium resource base, which is 10% of the world’s reserves and explored back in the 60s of the previous century. This is almost 4 million tons in 15 explored deposits. The first two objects in the Murmansk region will gain licensing and active subsoil use by the end of the current year. I think production might start there already in the next three or four years. Moreover, these are world-class deposits, both in terms of the lithium reserves and content,” O. Kazanov said.
According to him, now the demand for lithium is boosting in the world. Its driver is the battery industry. “Already in the next 10 years, we will see an increase from the current 100,000 tons of lithium consumption to about 700,000 tons. In total, 88 deposits of ore lithium will be launched in the world soon, but it is not enough to cover its entire global demand,” the expert notes.
Meanwhile, in Russia, a peculiar situation has developed in the lithium industry. The country has huge reserves of ore lithium reaching 10% of the world’s. Besides, Russia discovered lithium reserves in solutions in the bottom waters of the oil and gas fields in the Angara-Lena region, but they have not been fully assessed yet. The lithium content in solutions is very high by the world standards, i.e., about 300 mg/l.
There are two large lithium processing plants in Russia the Krasnoyarsk chemical-metallurgical plant, which buy raw lithium from Chile, bring it up to battery quality and ship to Southeast Asia.
Against the background of this situation, Federal Subsoil Resources Management Agency has recognized development of the lithium ore and brine reserves as a priority area.
Lithium ore mining technologies already exist; they scale well, especially considering increase of the demand for lithium and its price rise. “I think already on ore lithium, in the prospect of the next eight years, we are going to be among the top five producers of this metal along with Chile, Argentina, China and Australia,” O. Kazanov noted.
The next stage in the Russia’s lithium industry development after the ore deposits have been commissioned will be application of the technologies for lithium production from solutions. In the world, this is the DLE technology mainly used for solutions at geothermal power plants. In Russia, lithium solutions are found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields. This water is somehow extracted from the subsoil and injected back into the reservoir to maintain pressure in an oil and gas well.
The engineering center created based on the Krasnoyarsk chemical-metallurgical plant and VIMS developed its own technologies for lithium extraction just during a year, and now they are tested under the laboratory conditions.

By Marcelo Azevedo, Magdalena Baczyńska, Ken Hoffman, and Aleksandra Krauze
Lithium is the driving force behind electric vehicles, but will supply keep pace with demand? New technologies and sources of supply can fill the gap. 
Despite expectations that lithium demand will rise from approximately 500,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2021 to some three million to four million metric tons in 2030, we believe that the lithium industry will be able to provide enough product to supply the burgeoning lithium-ion battery industry. Alongside increasing the conventional lithium supply, which is expected to expand by over 300 percent between 2021 and 2030, direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP) can be the driving forces behind the industry’s ability to respond more swiftly to soaring demand. Although DLE and DLP technologies are still in their infancy and subject to volatility given the industry’s “hockey stick” 1 demand growth and lead times, they offer significant promise of increasing supply, reducing the industry’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) footprint, and lowering costs, with already announced capacity contributing to around 10 percent of the 2030 lithium supply, as well as to other less advanced projects in the pipeline.
However, satisfying the demand for lithium will not be a trivial problem. Despite COVID-19’s impact on the automotive sector, electric vehicle (EV) sales grew by around 50 percent in 2020 and doubled to approximately seven million units in 2021. At the same time, surging EV demand has seen lithium prices skyrocket by around 550 percent in a year: by the beginning of March 2022, the lithium carbonate price had passed $75,000 per metric ton and lithium hydroxide prices had exceeded $65,000 per metric ton (compared with a five-year average of around $14,500 per metric ton). 
Lithium is needed to produce virtually all traction batteries currently used in EVs as well as consumer electronics. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are widely used in many other applications as well, from energy storage to air mobility. As battery content varies based on its active materials mix, and with new battery technologies entering the market, there are many uncertainties around how the battery market will affect future lithium demand. For example, a lithium metal anode, which boosts energy density in batteries, has nearly double the lithium requirements per kilowatt-hour compared with the current widely used mixes incorporating a graphite anode.
So, will there be enough lithium to cover the needs of a new electrified world? As discussed in our recent article, “The raw-materials challenge: How the metals and mining sector will be at the core of enabling the energy transition,” arriving at a considered answer and understanding the entire supply-and-demand context will be crucial for every player along the value chain—mining companies, refiners, battery manufacturers, and automotive OEMs.
Lithium demand factors
Over the next decade, McKinsey forecasts continued growth of Li-ion batteries at an annual compound rate of approximately 30 percent. By 2030, EVs, along with energy-storage systems, e-bikes, electrification of tools, and other battery-intensive applications, could account for 4,000 to 4,500 gigawatt-hours of Li-ion demand.
  
Not long ago, in 2015, less than 30 percent of lithium demand was for batteries; the bulk of demand was split between ceramics and glasses (35 percent) and greases, metallurgical powders, polymers, and other industrial uses (35-plus percent). By 2030, batteries are expected to account for 95 percent of lithium demand, and total needs will grow annually by 25 to 26 percent to reach 3.3 million to 3.8 million metric tons LCE depending on the scenarios outlined in Exhibit 2. 


Reuse and recycle
A frequently asked question is whether L-ion batteries can be recycled. With expected battery lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles, and the possibility of extending EV battery life through use in the energy-storage sector, battery recycling is expected to increase during the current decade, but not to game-changing levels. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. By 2030, such secondary supply is expected to account for slightly more than 6 percent of total lithium production (Exhibit 7).",1,7.0,"Summary

Dear Ferdinand
I am back to you with the memo as you have requested. If you have any comment I can modify the memo still today. 
BACKGROUND
The goals of the European green deal and other climate change policies have underlined the strategic role plaied by batteries on reaching the environmental objectives. In fact, the batteries are necessary to boost the production of energy from renewable sources. 
The political agreement at EU level on the battery regulation is an important step. However, lithium, a key batteries material which is at the core of the batteries production cycle, is interested by a series of issues. These issues may compromise the goal of the proposal which aims at safe, sustainble and competitive batteries.
In fact, from the adoption of the regulation by the Commission, the context is changed. Outside the EU, the US may become extremely attractive to establish lithium production cycles on their territory by means of the IRA. Within the EU, the possible upcoming decision of the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) about the risk for human health because of certain key lithium salts, may compromise our internal investments on lithium supply and refining. 
MAIN ISSUES
Lithium is a key component of batteries. The global lithium demand will increase enormously in the next decade, and the global offer of lithium might not keep up the speed of the demand. This situation might be particularly critical in the EU where the lithium demand will be higher than in the rest of the world and the lithium mining and production is nonexistent. 
Nowadays, the EU depends on supply and refinement of Lithium from third countries. Opening lithium mines and establishing lithium refinement plants in Europe, as foreseen in the proposal, will reduce the dependency from the third countries.
However, if ECHA will decide to classify some key lithium salts hazardous for human health, its is expected that there will be an increase in the costs for mining and producing lithium in Europe, with potential exodus of investors.
In addition, on the other side of the Athlantic, the IRA makes extremely attractive to base lithium mining and refinement in the US terriotry.
WAY FORWARD
It is necessary to impement new measures in the batteries regulation to prevent troubles for the european market and update the regulation to the new context.
Firstly, regarding the production chain of batteries, we need to align the attractiveness of the EU market to those determined in the US by means of the IRA. Therefore we must value the production made in the EU and grant an incentive for each major stage of the production process. 
Secondly, independently from the ECHA decision, we cannot exclude that in future additional risks for human health will arise in the batteries product chain. Therefore we need to integrate the batteries regulation with a system that values the production chains that respect the EU law in terms of protection of the human health and on the other hand hinders those production chains that do not comply with the requirements for human health established by the EU. 
In the long run, we will be able also to count on lithium recycling and on the use of new technologies like Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) and Direct Lithium to production (DLP), and the use of materials alternative to lithium can be explored. However, we need to invest on EU reserach to make these paths much more concrete.
Before our internal meeting, I will reach our collegues in ECHA for an update on the potential ban for certain lithium salts (the decision was expected by the beginning of this year). In case the ECHA will ban key lithiums salts, a revision of the impact assessment for the batteries regulation is desirable, the feasibility of this has to be checked during the internal meeting.
AGENDA
I've kept the agenda very simple and focused on our main issues for the ISC consultations: 
1 - Opening;
2 - The proposal in the new context;
3 - Fine-tuning the proposal:
- the new global context  and attractiveness of the EU market;
- valuing protection of human health in the batteries production chain;
4 - Next steps for the fine-tuning of the proposal;
5 - Closing of the meeting.
I am available to support you on introducing points 3 ad 4 in partiular.  
Looking forward

The Benefits of Driverless Cars
(Excerpt from “The Driver in the Driverless Car - How our technology choices will create the future” by VIVEK WADHWA & ALEX SALKEVER)

Few people seem to fully grasp the profound improvement in our lives that driverless cars will bring. Their adoption will slash accident and fatality rates, saving millions of lives. As well, it will remove one-third to one-half of all vehicles from city streets. A large percentage of the cars on the streets of New York, San Francisco, and London at any one time are looking for parking; but self-driving cars don’t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers.  The Earth Institute at Columbia University projects a 75 per cent reduction in the cost of car ownership, because fewer shared vehicles will be necessary to provide the same service collectively that personally owned vehicles provide. During peak hours, those shared vehicles will be in use 90 per cent of the time. And, with no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient. 
Most important, car sharing will cost a fraction of what car ownership today costs. Owning a car for daily, personal transportation will seem impractical. Self-driving cars will also deliver incontrovertible social beneﬁts. With self-driving cars, the disabled will no longer struggle to ﬁnd transportation; they will have an on-demand personal driver. Several years ago Google’s self-driving car team contacted Steve Mahan, Executive Director of the Santa Clara Valley Blind Center. The team wanted feedback and let Mahan come along for test-drives in earlier self-driving Prius models as well as in the latest Google car. “My experience with Google has been terriﬁc, and I want it to happen,” Mahan told the Times. “Everyone in the blind community wants it to happen.” 
Other groups will also beneﬁt in tangible ways. Women and children will never worry about getting a cab ride late at night. Once all drivers are off the road, trafﬁc violations will no longer be an issue, and cops will have fewer reasons to pull over cars, which should reduce instances of the currently vicious discrimination against individuals “driving while black.” Teens will not face insurance discrimination as they do today, and their parents will not have to pay for the dubious privilege of teaching a teenager to drive. People living in the country will ﬁnally gain access to transportation services that put them nearly on par with their city cousins. Pedestrians will stop worrying about getting hit by cars in intersections.
Let me paint a picture of what streets will look like in an age of driverless cars. We will no longer need traffic lights: robot cars will synchronize wirelessly to time mass movements across city intersections and entries onto freeways or balletic dances around four-way stop signs. Having no human eyes behind the wheel will obviate much of the need for signalling and signage. When all the driverless cars are talking to each other, there will be no need for them to ever come to a complete halt and waste all their kinetic energy. So we will be able to forget traffic lights—and stop signs, yield signs, lighting on freeways, and dozens of other transportation-infrastructure elements catering to human drivers. This great elimination will save many, many billions of dollars in the United States. Equally important, self-driving cars will eliminate the need to build these types of infrastructure in less developed countries in which traffic lights, freeways, and other modern trafﬁc-control features have yet to be put in place. The future cost savings to those countries will be astronomical. In that future, the beneﬁts of self-driving cars will be far more evenly distributed.
Eliminating human drivers will also allow automobile designers to build cars from a completely different mind set. Driverless cars will not need steering columns, brake pedals, accelerator pedals or any of the other components drivers use for slowing or accelerating. They will not need a gearshift panel in the middle of the driver compartment or an emergency brake pedal. The A.I. system driving the car will also reduce accidents to negligible levels.

Robots and artificial intelligence: MEPs call for EU-wide liability rules

EU-wide rules are needed for the fast-evolving field of robotics, e.g. to enforce ethical standards or establish liability for accidents involving driverless cars, say MEPs in a resolution voted on Thursday. 
MEPs ask the EU Commission to propose rules on robotics and artificial intelligence, in order to fully exploit their economic potential and to guarantee a standard level of safety and security. They note that regulatory standards for robots are being planned in several countries, and point out that the EU needs to take the lead on setting these standards, so as not to be forced to follow those set by third countries.
Rapporteur Mady Delvaux (S&D, LU) said “Although I am pleased that the plenary adopted my report on robotics, I am also disappointed that the right-wing coalition of ALDE, EPP and ECR refused to take account of possible negative consequences on the job market. They rejected an open-minded and forward-looking debate and thus disregarded the concerns of our citizens.”
Liability rules and the impact of robots on the workforce
MEPs stress that draft legislation is urgently needed to clarify liability issues, especially for self-driving cars. They call for a mandatory insurance scheme and a supplementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driverless cars are fully compensated.
MEPs also ask the Commission to consider creating a specific legal status for robots in the long run, in order to establish who is liable if they cause damage.
The rapid development of robots might result in changes in the labour market through the creation, displacement and loss of certain jobs. MEPs urge the Commission to follow these trends closely.
A Code of Ethical Conduct and a new European Agency for robotics
The growing use of robotics also raises ethical issues, for example to do with privacy and safety, stress MEPs. They propose a voluntary ethical code of conduct on robotics for researchers and designers to ensure that they operate in accordance with legal and ethical standards and that robot design and use respect human dignity.
They also ask the Commission to consider creating a European agency for robotics and artificial intelligence, to supply public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise.
The resolution was passed by 396 votes to 123, with 85 abstentions. The Commission will not be obliged to follow the Parliament’s recommendations, but must state its reasons if it refuses.





PRESS RELEASE
10-03-20XX
Regulatory and legal framework for automated vehicles
Road traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. Different national jurisdictions can hinder the development and deployment of new technologies for systems or vehicles. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness.
Regulation of road traffic
The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968 (‘Vienna Convention of 1968') is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety by establishing standard traffic rules among the contracting parties. All EU Member States are signatories of the Vienna Convention — only the UK and Spain have not ratified it. 
One of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept, as laid down in Article 8, that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic.
The amended convention (20XX-1) still demands that every vehicle must have a driver. However, in the future it will be in accordance with the Convention that highly automated systems will have a driver who may take the hands off the wheel, but must be ready at all times to take over the driving functions, and who can override the system and switch it on and off. A further amendment process is therefore necessary to permit driverless vehicles. Systems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.
Technical requirements
Technical requirements for vehicles are internationally harmonised in the framework of the two following UNECE Agreements:
The 1958 Agreement provides the framework for establishing international UN Regulations with uniform performance—oriented test provisions and administrative procedures for granting type approvals, for the conformity of production and for the mutual recognition of the type approvals granted. The 1958 Agreement currently has 54 contracting parties and 135 annexed UN Regulations.
The 1998 Agreement concerns the establishing of global technical regulations for the construction of new vehicles, including performance requirements. Its purpose is to further enhance the process of international harmonisation through the development of global technical regulations (GTR). The 1998 Agreement has 35 Contracting Parties and 16 UN GTRs, established in the UN Global Registry (March 20XX-2).
The European Union is a contracting party to the 1958 and the 1998 Agreement. 
Under the European vehicle type approval system, manufacturers can obtain approval for a new vehicle type in one EU Member State if it meets the EU technical requirements. The manufacturer can then market it EU—wide with no need for further approval tests or checks in other Member States. The approval is granted by a national authority in charge of type approval. The completion of the type approval examination results in issuance of a Certificate of Conformity, which is a statement by the manufacturer that the vehicle conforms to the relevant legal requirements as stipulated by EU legislation.
The common legal framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers is provided by a Framework Directive. Within the EU, mass—produced cars may only be used on public roads if they are type—approved in compliance with the administrative procedures and technical requirements established by the Directive.
General regulatory environment
The regulatory environment relating to cyber security, data privacy, and liability issues is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles.
Today's connected vehicles are already equipped with extensive IT communication capabilities. In-vehicle networks for information and entertainment co-exist with automotive control networks. The different networks have different degrees of relevance for the safe functioning of the vehicle and for cyber security risks and data protection issues.
Automated vehicles are extended vehicles, meaning that they have external software and hardware extensions as some of their features. These extensions are developed, implemented and managed by the vehicle manufacturer. The connection between the in—vehicle system and the manufacturer's central server has to be secure, so that all data transfers are protected from unauthorised disclosure and manipulation.
Uncontrolled, unrestricted access to vehicle data in the on-board network by third parties directly and indirectly jeopardises the safety of the vehicle, occupants and other road users. Media report increasingly on cyber security problems related to cars, for instance covering the successful attempt of hacking into a vehicle and controlling its basic driving functions via the entertainment and navigation software.
The debate on data privacy regarding connected automated vehicles is evolving in parallel with the new technologies. In general, digital services will be available in vehicles, as they are anywhere else. The ‘connected car‘ has the capability to generate, store and transmit users‘ personal data, such as their route to work, time of driving, favourite music, appointments or favourite restaurants. These data have a significant potential for other uses. As third parties can access and use sensitive driver and driving data, legislation seems necessary to protect personal privacy of consumers in connected vehicles.
The new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regard to digital technologies, valid across the EU.
Liability issues
Traffic accidents have very large costs in economic terms, in particular regarding human lives or health, or regarding damage to an object. Liability law answers the question of who is responsible and who has to bear the costs of an accident.
In the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products (Council Directive 85/374/EEC). A producer is liable for any damage caused by a defect in his product; a product is defective when it does not provide the safety which the consumer is entitled to expect.
However, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved — the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States.
Most liability regimes in the EU use a concept of causality for determining and allocating liability. From a certain level of vehicle automation on, it might be difficult to establish the exact cause of an accident and to prove if it is due to a defect with the automated vehicle or the behaviour of the driver. The new possible causes created by automation might interfere with the very objective of liability regimes to apportion risks, therefore an adaptation of liability law to the new technologies and a European harmonisation of the regimes concerning the liability of owners and/or drivers of automated vehicles seem necessary.

 


EU Commission drives home merits of autonomous vehicles
By Dave Keating | EURACTIV.com 
 Apr 6, 20XX

Can driverless cars chauffeur people to a love of the EU? The European Commission is betting it can.
Christmas came early for automated driving enthusiasts this week. Convening a two-day summit in Brussels on the subject – the first of its kind – the European Commission promised a sack of goodies in the form of dedicated funding, regulatory changes, cross-border agreements and innovation stimulus.
Driverless trucks could be a reality on European motorways within two years, officials said. They would first operate in convoys where the first truck is driven by a human being but all the trucks following are driverless.
It’s the first step in a roadmap, to be published by the Commission as part of its transport strategy on 31 May, that could see driverless cars integrated with traffic by 20XX+10.
“Owning a non-autonomous car will soon be like owning a horse,” said Carlos Moedas, the EU commissioner for research, science and innovation, who spoke at the conference.
Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has identified driverless vehicles as an area where the EU can deliver tangible benefits to citizens. In his five-scenario white paper on the future of Europe, released last month ahead of the EU’s 60th anniversary summit in Rome, connected and autonomous driving (CAD) was used repeatedly as an example of something that cannot become a reality without the EU.
In a scenario in which the EU downgrades to only a free trade zone, “Europeans are reluctant to use connected cars due to the absence of EU-wide rules and technical standards,” the paper concluded.
Three weeks later, national leaders signed an agreement in Rome to not only allow cross-border tests and experiments but also to establish one single point of contact in each country to approve them.
Highway cruising
Trucks are expected to be the first to go driverless, both because they drive on motorways and because they are the most commercially interesting. Though convoys following a lead driven vehicle will be the first step, the next step will be completely independent automated trucks.
Motorways present the safest environment for CAD because they are free of pedestrians and are more or less in a straight line. They are also more uniform throughout Europe. In the very near future trucks will be driven within cities by a driver, but then dropped off at the motorway to continue its journey alone. When the truck arrives at its destination, a new driver would pick it up at the motorway exit.
“Lisbon to Warsaw today is four and a half days, but that could be brought down to one and a half,” José Manuel Viegas, secretary-general of the International Transport Forum at the OECD, told euractiv.com.
“It’s very useful for trucks and buses not only because it would save on labour costs and operation, but because it could operate 24 hours a day.” 
Semi-autonomous ‘platoons’ of trucks from around Europe will travel to Rotterdam in early April as part of an experiment backed by the Dutch Council presidency.
Vienna Convention needs updating
Despite the Commission’s enthusiasm, this isn’t low-hanging fruit. It isn’t only the EU that is causing regulatory uncertainty in this field. Globally, rules on driving are harmonised by the UN’s 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.
Joost Vantomme, smart mobility Director at the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), said the rules need to be clarified. “Article eight says you need to have a driver in the vehicle, and they need to be in control of the vehicle,” he said. “But what is a driver? Can it be a computer? And what does it mean to be in control of the vehicle?”
As the technology for automated driving has called article eight into question, different countries have interpreted these rules differently. Antti Vehviläinen, director-general of the Finnish Transport Agency, told the conference that Finland has chosen a loose interpretation. “The driver does not need to be in the car, he just needs to be in control,” he said.
The EU’s early efforts at clarification could mean that the bloc ends up setting the standards later adopted at the UN. It can take four to five years to modify a UN treaty, and work has not even begun yet.
Public worry
But is automated driving really the vote-winner that the Commission is imagining? There was much worry at the conference that fears over driverless cars are going to trump the benefits. What will someone think if they are driving on the motorway and see a driverless car next to them?
In Gothenburg Sweden, they’re about to find out. Volvo is launching a project this year called DriveMe, which will put driverless vehicles on real roads with other drivers. The company wants to test how other drivers react, as well as other safety considerations.
The safety worries are a significant hurdle. At a special break-away panel dedicated to the human factors in CAD, most people agreed that people will over-trust automation and this could present dangers. Almost everyone agreed that operating an automated vehicle should require special training, and half said vehicles should alert others when they are in automated mode.
This will be a difficult question for regulators, Viegas admitted. “A minister will know that giving approval today and then having a fatal accident tomorrow will result in him being fired,” he said. “You need to be able to guarantee that the automated vehicle would not fail in a scenario in which a human would not fail.”
Still, the mood at the Brussels conference was positive. There was a general consensus that, as long as safety concerns can be addressed, the EU is on to a winner by identifying autonomous vehicles as an area where it will demonstrate innovation leadership and quick regulatory adjustment.
“Imagine on our roads trucks platooning with big signs saying ‘Europe on the move’,” said Roberto Vavassori, president of the European automotive suppliers association CLEPA. “It would be a sign that EU legislation is there to improve quality of life for our people,” he told the conference enthusiastically.



Autonomous driving levels 0 to 5: Understanding the differences
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted the Society of Automotive Engineers' (SAE) levels for automated driving systems, ranging from complete driver control to full autonomy. 
By Hope Reese | January 20, 20X-1, 10:47 AM PST 
Between Tesla's announcement that every car in production will now have the capability for full autonomy by 20XX+1 and the Obama administration's plan to invest almost $4 billion in autonomous vehicle research over the next 10 years, the race to create the best driverless car has never been hotter.
The rise of driverless vehicles is going to have a major impact on businesses and professionals. Automated vehicles could replace corporate fleets for deliveries or transporting employees, for example. And workers could gain productive hours in the day by working instead of driving during daily commutes. Innovations in this field are also poised to completely change the car insurance industry by reducing accidents—a new report predicts that accidents will drop by 80% by 20XX+20
But, what does ""autonomous driving"" really mean? The US Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defined five different levels of autonomous driving. In October 20XX-1, the NHTSA updated their policy to reflect that they have officially adopted the levels of autonomy outlined in the SAE International's J3016 document.
The NHTSA is ""working to transform government for the 21st century, harnessing innovation and technology that will improve people's lives,"" according to a representative. ""This is an area of rapid change, which requires the Department Of Transport and NHTSA to remain flexible and adaptable as new information and technologies emerge. Amid that rapid change, the North Star for Department Of Transport and NHTSA remains safety."" 
It's important to remember that the levels of autonomy describe the system, not the vehicle, said Bryant Walker Smith, professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law and School of Engineering and one of the top experts in the driverless cars world. ""A Level 5 automated driving system could be in a vehicle with or without a steering wheel,"" he explained.
Here's what you need to know about levels 0-5. The biggest difference is that, starting at Level 3, the automated driving system becomes able to monitor the driving environment.
Level 0: This one is pretty basic. The driver (human) controls it all: steering, brakes, throttle, power. It's what you've been doing all along.
Level 1: This driver-assistance level means that most functions are still controlled by the driver, but a specific function (like steering or accelerating) can be done automatically by the car.
Level 2: In level 2, at least one driver assistance system of ""both steering and acceleration/ deceleration using information about the driving environment"" is automated, like cruise control and lane-centering. It means that the ""driver is disengaged from physically operating the vehicle by having his or her hands off the steering wheel AND foot off pedal at the same time,"" according to the SAE. The driver must still always be ready to take control of the vehicle, however. 
Level 3: Drivers are still necessary in level 3 cars, but are able to completely shift ""safety-critical functions"" to the vehicle, under certain traffic or environmental conditions. It means that the driver is still present and will intervene if necessary, but is not required to monitor the situation in the same way it does for the previous levels. Jim McBride, autonomous vehicles expert at Ford, said this is ""the biggest demarcation is between Levels 3 and 4."" He's focused on getting Ford straight to Level 4, since Level 3, which involves transferring control from car to human, can often pose difficulties. ""We're not going to ask the driver to instantaneously intervene—that's not a fair proposition,"" McBride said.
Level 4: This is what is meant by ""fully autonomous."" Level 4 vehicles are ""designed to perform all safety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip."" However, it's important to note that this is limited to the ""operational design domain (ODD)"" of the vehicle - meaning it does not cover every driving scenario.
Level 5: This refers to a fully-autonomous system that expects the vehicle's performance to equal that of a human driver, in every driving scenario—including extreme environments like dirt roads that are unlikely to be navigated by driverless vehicles in the near future. 
Why it matters
So why are the levels important? They serve as general guidelines for how technologically advanced a vehicle is. In terms of what consumers need to know, Thilo Koslowski, former analyst for Gartner, thinks that ultimately, there are three stages that will be relevant: ""automated, autonomous, and driverless."" It's important to distinguish between ""autonomous"" and ""driverless,"" he said: ""driverless is a more advanced stage of autonomous.""
But while drivers themselves may be less concerned with the distinctions, the differences could be significant when it comes to issues like car insurance, which is expected to change radically in the era of self-driving cars. 
KPMG, a consulting firm, has issued a report on how the car insurance business will be affected, since the number of accidents are predicted to go down 80% over the coming 20 years. The different levels are important because they ""change the risk profile of the car,"" according to KPMG expert Jerry Albright. ""Insurance companies need to understand how these new capabilities affect driving risk."" Joe Schneider, managing director at KPMG, put it this way: ""It's like a baby, going from crawling to walking to running."" Albright said, ""The car becomes safer and safer as it moves towards fully-autonomous driving.""

Internal Memo

Challenges for automated vehicles in the EU

The potential impact of the deployment of automated vehicles raises many questions. The answers are still under discussion, having ethical, legal, financial, economic and technical dimensions. While most of the scientific discussion has to date dealt with the development of the technology, the focus recently is shifting towards topics such as user acceptance and legal issues. Policy makers, in particular, face challenges in designing the appropriate legal and regulatory framework so that new technologies are used properly and for the benefit of society.

Legal framework for road safety

Regulation of automated vehicles faces challenges to establish rules for technologies not yet applied. In particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed. Traffic rules and the regulatory framework need to be adapted. In addition, it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom. The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of driving education and licensing.

Infrastructure and technical standards

Automated and connected vehicles need special features in infrastructure. What needs to be done at the infrastructure level has yet to be clarified. An important prerequisite for intelligent transport systems will be an agreement on what communication is needed between vehicles (V2V), between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) and vehicles to anyone else. Technical standardisation is necessary for international compatibility and interoperability.

Data processing

The new technologies raise questions as to how data privacy and cyber security will be addressed. The highly or fully automated vehicle will process data and make decisions: this raises ethical issues which have to be solved in a societal dialogue. The programmed algorithms will make decisions in conflicting situations, such as a choice between two unavoidable crash scenarios. How will the decision be taken? What 'best driving behaviour' should be reflected by the system?

Liability issues

In case of malfunction of an automated vehicle, who is liable when such malfunctions result in an accident: the manufacturer, the owner or the driver has to be clarified.




Examples for the different levels of automation

Level 0 - Park Distance Control (already deployed): The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals.

Level 1 - Park Assist (already deployed): The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces. The system assists the driver by automatically carrying out the optimum steering movements in order to reverse - park on the ideal line. The measurement of the parking space, the allocation of the starting position and the steering movements are automatically undertaken – all the driver has to do is operate the accelerator and the brake. This means that the driver retains control of the car at all times.

Level 2 - Traffic Jam Assist (already deployed): The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h). The system can be seen as an extension of the Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop&Go functionality, i.e. no lane change support.

Level 3 - Traffic Jam Chauffeur (already deployed): Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads. The system can be activated in a traffic jam scenario. It detects a slow-driving vehicle in front and then handles the vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Later versions of this functionality might include lane change functionality.

Level 4 - Highway Pilot (possible deployment 20XX+4): Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver must deliberately activate the system, but does not have to monitor it constantly. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. There is no request from the system to the driver to take over when the system is in its normal operation area on the motorway. Depending on the deployment of vehicle-to-vehicle communication and cooperative systems, ad-hoc convoys could also be created.

Level 5 – The fully automated vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger. According to ERTRAC only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10.




Self-driving cars could cost America's professional drivers up to 25,000 jobs a month, Goldman Sachs says

Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan 
Published 2:45 PM ET Mon, 22 May 20XX
The full impact of self-driving cars on society is several decades away — but when it hits, the job losses will be substantial for American truck drivers, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs. When autonomous vehicle saturation peaks, U.S. drivers could see job losses at a rate of 25,000 a month, or 300,000 a year, according to a report from Goldman Sachs Economics Research. Truck drivers, more so than bus or taxi drivers, will see the bulk of that job loss, according to the report. That makes sense, given today's employment: In 20XX-3, there were 4 million driver jobs in the U.S., 3.1 million of which were truck drivers, Goldman said. That represents 2 per cent of total employment. The report estimates that semi- and fully autonomous car sales will have about 20 per cent share of car sales around 20XX+10. The report comes as fierce competition to make self-driving cars is shaking up companies from the inside out. 
Uber formally launched Uber Freight last week with a self-driving executive at the helm, expanding its reach in the trucking industry, even as it fights in court with Alphabet over whether some of its technology is stolen. And at Ford, the CEO will be replaced by a self-driving car expert, in an effort to ""transform Ford for the future."" Near term, the analysts predict that occupations like secretaries, cashiers, bank tellers, waiters and real estate agents could also be at risk of automation.
To be sure, the report estimates that the full effects of self-driving cars will be delayed by regulation and slow adoption. The report as a whole strikes an optimistic tone on the future of the labor market, noting that many different employment and productivity measures in the United States do not show massive disruption from labor-replacing technologies. 
Industries like department stores, telecom, printing, publishing and manufacturing have seen the biggest job losses over the past 13 years, while sectors like food services, education, computer design and home healthcare have been winners, the report said. ""Demand for health care, education and food services is likely to rise further with aggregate income, and should also benefit from broader trends including aging and consumers' desire for new experiences,"" the report said. ""More fundamentally, we suspect that several of the skills central to those sectors — including empathy, humor, creativity and problem solving — are hard to codify and automate.""",33,7.0,"Summary

Briefing Note / DG Mobility and Transport
Automated vehicle technologies allow the transfer of driving functions from a human driver to a computer. Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility. However,automated vehicle technologies require an effective legislative framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of legitimate concerns.
Potentials and challenges of vehicle automation
Potential benefits of vehicle automation
1. Increased road safety: As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure for drivers and pedestrians alike. A KPMG report predicts an 80% drop in accidents in 20 years.
2. Environmental benefits: Vehicles will be lighter and more fuel efficient which will lead to reduced energy demand. In addition, their used is optimised and they pick up and drop customers constantly without needing to spend energy and time looking for parking (i.e. in peak hours, these vehicles will be used 90% of the time in large cities).
3. Increased affordability of car ownership/sharing: The costs of car ownership are expected to drop by 75%.
4. Accesibility: People with reduced mobility, disability or living in rural areas will have easier access to mobility services.
Challenges and drawbacks
1. Unclear liability in case of accidents: Although reduced, accidents will continue happening and there needs to be a way to ensure that the liabile party is clear and that victims are compensated.
2. Ethical issues: Given the data driven nature of driveless car sharing, some privacy and data safety issues will emerge. The automated systems will also take decisions (e.g. among different options in a car crash scenario) which will need ethical oversight.
3. Job market impacts: The development of the sector might result in the displacement of some jobs and the loss of others. The size of the sector is considerable (e.g. 2% of US total employment).
4. Difficulties adapting to fragmeted road traffic regulation: Europe has different national juristdictions when it comes to road traffic and this can inder the deployment of new technologies for systems or vehicles.
The different levels of automation and their deployment
Levels of Automation
There are different levels of automation ranging from already deployed mechanisms like park assistance or traffic jam assistance to vehicles without a driving wheel.
The US Department of Transportations's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) an dETRAC provide different definitions of 5 levels of automation. All in all, there are 3 stages whose differences will be determinan for regulation and insurance: Automated, Autonomous and Driveress.
Deployment
The first commercial uses of the technology are likely to be driverless trucks first deployed as part of convoys lead by a driven vehicle and then as fully autonomous series of automated trucks. Motorways will be the safets place for CAD test as they are pedestrian free, often straight and uniform across Europe.
Regulatory and legal frameworks, state of play
The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic from 1968 (ratified by all EU MS except of Spain) is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and increase road safety by establishing stadard traffic rules among parties. However, Article 8 establishes that the driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. Its amendment still demands that each vehicle must have a driver so the Convention needs to be further amended to adapt to driverless vehicles and clarified as different countries are choosing to interpret Article 8 in different ways.
An EU regulation of the sector could mean that the EC sents the standards for the later international UN treaty, which could take up to 5 years to modify.
Technical requirements for Vehicles are harmonised in the framework of two UNECE agreements (1958 and 1998) where the EU is a contracting party. In addition, Certificates of Conformity, issued by any EU member state, certifying that a vehicle meets all relevant legal requirements, are accepted in all other members.
Regulatory standards for robots are being planned in several countries and the EU needs to take the lead on setting the standards to avoid having to follow standards set by others.he regulation of the sector will need to overcome the challenges identified including the harmonization of traffic regulations and vehicle requirements but also data processing, liability issues, infrastructure and vehicle to vehicle (V2V) interoperability.
Ongoing work in the EU
The White Paper on the Furture of Europe identifies autonomous vehicles as an areas where the EU can deliver tangible benefits to citizens.
The Commission foresees to publish a Roadmap as part of the EU Transport Strategy on the 31st of May.

1. Creating a specific legal status for robots to establish who is liable in case of accidents.
2. Making inusrance mandatory and creating a supplementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driveless cars are compensated
3. Creating a European Agency for robotics and artificial intelligence to support public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise in the field.
4. The creation of a voluntary ethical code of conduct on robotics for researchers and designers could ensure that they operate in accordance with legal and ethical standards while respecting human dignity."
