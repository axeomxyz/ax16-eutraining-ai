The legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of batteries, from raw material supply chain to production, reuse, and recycling. The proposal aligns with the European Green Deal, Circular Economy Action Plan, and New Industrial Strategy. The Council and European Parliament have reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. An internal reflection and brainstorming meeting is planned to fine-tune the original proposal in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to build a resilient lithium supply chain\n\nSummary: Europe is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for lithium, a key metal used in batteries for electric vehicles. The European Union (EU) plans to release its Critical Raw Materials Act, which will identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk. The EU aims to become climate neutral by 2050 and has set ambitious goals for the electrification of transportation. However, challenges faced by carmakers and concerns about supply availability and access to raw materials continue to impact the growth of the electric vehicle market in Europe.\n\nHeadline: European Commission considers classifying lithium as toxic\n\nSummary: The European Commission is considering a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If approved, this classification could undermine the EU's efforts to create a domestic battery materials supply chain. The EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium for its electric vehicle production sector, and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions. The proposal could have an impact on lithium mining, processing, cathode production, and recycling.\n\nHeadline: The Inflation Reduction Act stimulates battery mineral mining in the US\n\nSummary: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US is expected to stimulate a \"gold rush\" in battery mineral mining, refining, and production. The IRA offers tax credits for various stages of battery production and the battery supply chain, making it more appealing for companies to bring full-cycle battery production to the US. This includes mining and refining battery minerals, producing battery cells, and battery pack production. The IRA aims to reduce the US's dependence on China for battery minerals and increase domestic production.\n\nHeadline: Russia plans to start lithium mining in the next few years\n\nSummary: Russia is planning to start lithium mining based on ore deposits in the Murmansk region within the next three to four years. The country has significant lithium reserves, accounting for 10% of the world's reserves. The demand for lithium is expected to increase in the next decade, and Russia aims to become one of the world's top five producers of lithium. The next stage of Russia's lithium industry development will be the application of technologies for lithium production from solutions found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields.\n\nHeadline: Meeting the growing demand for lithium in the electric vehicle industry\n\nSummary: The demand for lithium is expected to rise significantly due to the growing electric vehicle industry. Despite the expected increase in demand, the lithium industry is expected to provide enough supply to meet the needs of the lithium-ion battery industry. In addition to increasing conventional lithium supply, new technologies such as direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP) offer promise in increasing supply, reducing the industry's environmental impact, and lowering costs. Battery recycling is also expected to increase, providing a secondary supply of lithium.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the Case Study. \nMemo | Regulation on batteries and waste batteries | In December 20XX-2, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on batteries and waste batteries. The proposal aims to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery life cycle. The initiative is closely linked to the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the New Industrial Strategy.  | At the end of last year, The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. For the first time the legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of a battery \u2013 from the supply chain of raw materials, over the production to reuse and recycling of batteries \u2013 and ensure that they are safe, sustainable, and competitive. | The purpose of this memo is to launch the interservice consultation procedure for the new Regulation on Batteries and waste batteries. It is intended to structure the review of the original proposal, considering the observations of the Council and the European Parliament, and to further materialize the specific requirements by setting measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based targets and objectives. |  | Context | The European Union (EU) has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Recently proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035. | As sales of electric vehicles increase, carmakers are looking to secure supply of key metals used in batteries, including lithium. Today, Europe is quite dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply and China for lithium refining. While only around 9% of the world's lithium is mined in China, around 60% is refined there. | With expected battery lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles, and the possibility of extending EV battery life through use in the energy-storage sector, battery recycling is expected to increase during the current decade, but not to game-changing levels. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. By 2030, such secondary supply is expected to account for slightly more than 6 percent of total lithium production. | Although Europe is pushing to build a resilient supply chain by partnering with allies and developing domestic resources, it might not all be good news for miners in the region \u2014 at the end of last year, the European Commission said it will weigh a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, recycling, and handling of the materials.  |  | Agenda | General  | The new regulation should apply to all batteries including all waste portable batteries, electric vehicle batteries, industrial batteries, starting, lightning and ignition batteries, and batteries for light means of transport (e.g., electric bikes, e-mopeds, e-scooters). | Supply chain of raw materials | EU needs to boost its local mining and refining capacity and shift more towards trustworthy suppliers.  | Target for local mining: cover the EU needs for XX% by 20XX+Y.  | Due diligence of raw materials\u2019 origin, carbon intensity requirements and more efficient use of raw materials. Target date: end of 20XX+Y. Possible exemption for SMEs from the due diligence rules (to be discussed). | Refinery: More recycled content in new batteries second life for industrial batteries. Targets for producers to collect waste portable batteries (XX% by the end of 20XX+Y). Introduction of dedicated collection objective for waste batteries for light means of transport (YY% by the end of 20XX+Y). | Market: Promote a circular battery industry, market for secondary raw materials, clearer labelling, and information with \u201cbattery passports\u201d and QR codes | End of use: Strict collection schemes and recycling targets, better ways of re-using old batteries, battery traceability, more efficient recycling of waste batteries, ensure the environmentally sound treatment of waste batteries, incentives for further recycling. | Production of batteries in the EU | 20XX+1: additional investment of \u20acXX billion in R&D for European battery production and electric cars. | Targets: by 20XX+Y Local producers cover the EU's demand and by 20XX+Y, EU produces next generation battery and EV technologies.  | By 20XX+Y, the EU sets a global sustainable standard in the global market. | Functioning of the internal market  | The new rules aim to improve the functioning of the internal market for batteries and ensure fairer competition. This will be reached through performance, durability and safety criteria, tight restrictions for hazardous substances like mercury, cadmium and lead and mandatory information on the carbon footprint of batteries. The regulation also introduces labelling and information requirements, among other things on the battery's components and recycled content, and an electronic \u201cbattery passport\u201d and a QR code. | Setting of a realistic implementation schedule.\u00a0Notably, labelling requirements will apply after XX months after entry into force of the Regulation and after XX months for the QR code. |  |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n \nBrussels, 01 March 20XX\n \nNOTE  FOR THE ATTENTION OF HEAD OF UNIT\nSubject: Commission proposal regulation on batteries\n1. INTRODUCTION\nFrom September  20XX the Commission will propose  \"The new European critical act\" a new  regulation on ricycle and waste of the Lithium Battery, linked to circular Economy and to Green Deal. The new piece of legislation aims to guarantee Europe's green transition and  point out new potential strategic project to ensure strategic access to raw material, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery cycle.\n2. UNDERLYING ISSUES OF THE GROWING REQUEST OF LITHIUM BATTERY\nLast year the market share of battery electric cars doubled around 10 percent and as declared from Oliver Zipse Acea president and Ceo of Bmw : \"Europe needs an Eu Critical Raw Materials Act that ensure strategic access to the raw materials needed for e-mobility, and an accelerated roll-out of charging infrastructure\" (source \"Inn\", Priscilla Barrera, Nov 16, 20xx-1).\nAs underlined from European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, the goal of the European Critical Material act is to  identify strategic projects  and build up reserves where supply is at risk. Europe needs to improve charging infrastructure in order to avoid the risk to be fully dependent from China.\nAt the moment Eu is looking at North America that recently introduced a policy of climate incentives and to detach from China. Europe has the capacity to improve his autonomy from Asia, even if the scenario can deeply change after the Commission will decide about how classify lithium carbonate.\n2.1 The European Chemicals Agency point out the health risk of lithium carbonate.\nThe European Commission will analyze the proposal of European Chemical Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. European Commission has the responsibility to guarantee the right to health of European Citizens but at the same time adds lithium to a list of critical raw material will impact on the  improvement of Eu supply chains. \n2.2 Economic consequences of declare lithium as toxic.\n- Increasing costs of mining, processing, cathode production and recycling;\n- Increasing costs of import procedure;\n- Closing of some plants: recently Albemarle declared that will close his plan in  Langelsheim (north Germany) if this decision will be adopted.  This issue will influence 600 employees. \n- Exodus of Eu producers including battery recyclers.\n- Protests of citizens against the plants.\n3. THE US POLICY, PRO AND CONS\nChina dominates the Ev battery market and the USA currently mines and refines close to 0% of the minerals that go into EV battery packs. To improve lithium market conditions, the Biden administration launched the Ira incentives, a series of bonuses that make the American market appealing from many point of view. The main corporate teams are looking at the Ira seriously and starting to reconsider where is more opportune to launch the production with potential negative impact on the Eu market.\n4. RUSSIA  AS ONE OF THE NEXT MAIN PRODUCERS  \nIt is important to consider that also Russia could become one of the worlds's five largest producers in eight years' time, due to his lithium resources that are 10% of the world's reserves.\nThis aspect must be analyzed as related to a strong impact on world market.\n5. LITHIUM BATTERY : REUSE AND RECYCLE\nLithium batteries have a lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles and depending on the recycling process employed it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. This means that by 2030 recycled batteries will account for slightly more than 6 percent o total lithium production.\n6. RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe lithium market is growing and changing very fast, there are structural problems and different factors that need to be analyzed from our side in order to consider all the options and solution. It is essential that Europe will be a primary actor of this global trend otherwise the Green Deal could be put at risk. The Commission has to step up effort to investigate and prosecute the best strategy and evaluete incentive policy and alliances with realiable partners.\nYou\n \n AGENDA OF 2 MARCH 20XX\n- Regulation on lithium battery advantages and disadvantages. \n- Increase of lithium demand: how che circular economy can help this trend, the needs to increase the lithium production and become more independent from Russia and China.\n- Build a net of infrastructure able to guarantee the growth of the demand.\n- How to satisfy the demand and be sustainable at the same time ?

Commission VP for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton met with representatives of these organizations to discuss the issue. Jourov\u00e1 will present her initiative at a press point, emphasizing the importance of fighting disinformation in the context of defending democracy and EU values.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: The Most Pressing Dangers of AI\n\nSummary: AI systems pose various risks and dangers that need to be addressed. These include techno-solutionism, which views AI as a panacea and can lead to larger problems; the adoption of a statistical perspective on justice, which can result in biased outcomes; the potential for disinformation and threats to democracy through AI manipulation; discrimination and risk in the medical setting; and the risks associated with generative AI, such as deepfakes and the spread of misinformation. The European Commission is proposing a regulatory framework on AI to address these risks and ensure the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses. Additionally, the EU is pushing for AI labels to identify AI-generated content and fight against deepfakes and disinformation.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \nPress point by Commission VP Jourova on generative AI\n10th of June 20XX at 11:15 \u2013 Charlemagne building (Room TBD) \n(INTRODUCTION)\nGood morning.\nWe are living in a Brave New World.\nGenerative AI is making breathtaking advances \u2014 from writing texts to creating ever more realistic pictures and videos.\nOver these last months we have been baffled by the exploits of ChatGTP and DALL.E, to the point that many of us in this room are fearing for their job in a not-so-distant future.\nBut there is more: generative AI will have enormous consequences not just for the future of our work, but for society, politics, and democracy. \nYesterday, Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton and myself have met representatives of 40-odd companies and organizations that have signed up to the EU\u2019s Code of Practice against disinformation. \nWe have asked them to come up with a clear labelling system to identify AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation. \nThe Commission wants to prevent artificial intelligence from blurring the lines between fact and fiction.\nToday, I would like to put this initiative in its wider context for you.\n(PAUSE)\n(WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI)\nNow, what exactly is generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\nGenerative AI generates outputs that appear authentic and human-like: text, images, graphics, music, etc.\nGenerative AI algorithms learn from training data that include examples of the desired output. \nBased on the patterns and structures within the training data, generative AI models can produce new content that shares characteristics with the original input data. \nThe most compelling advantage generative AI proposes is that it enables businesses to automate specific tasks and focus time, energy, and resources on more important strategic objectives:\nFor example, in content creation, generative AI can produce text, images and even music, assisting marketers, journalists, and artists with their creative processes. \nIn customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can provide more personalized assistance and reduce response times.\nGenerative AI is used in medicine to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs, saving time and money in research. \n\n(PAUSE)\n\n(THE DANGERS OF GENERATIVE AI)\nHowever, generative AI presents numerous issues requiring attention. \nOne major concern is its potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThe technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage. \nDisinformation poses serious threats to society, as it effectively changes and manipulates evidence to create social feedback loops that undermine any sense of objective truth. \nAI systems used to spread disinformation on the internet, can become a threat to society, politics, and democracy. \n(PAUSE)\n\n(LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON AI)\nSome two years ago, the European Commission began drafting the first-ever legal framework on AI, addressing the risks of AI and positioning Europe to play a leading role globally. \nA couple of weeks ago, this new Legal Framework on AI entered the co-decision stage. \nUnder the proposals, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level: from minimal through to limited, high, and unacceptable. \nWhile high-risk tools will not be banned, those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations.\nClearly, many generative AI systems belong in the high-risk category.\n(PAUSE)\n(NEW RULES FOR GENERATIVE AI)\nLast April, the European Union proposed new copyright rules for generative AI.\nCompanies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney, will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems.\nSome committee members initially proposed banning copyrighted material being used to train generative AI models altogether, but this was abandoned in favour of a transparency requirement.\nClear Labels. Services with a potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation should put in place technology to recognize such content and clearly label this to users. \nThe label should apply to all AI-generated material that can be used to create disinformation, including text, images, audio, and video.\nOn the other hand, services that integrate generative AI like Bingchat for Microsoft, Bard for Google should build in necessary safeguards that these services cannot be used by malicious actors to generate disinformation.\nFor now, labelling wouldn\u2019t be mandatory, given that it would be part of the voluntary Code of Practice. \nHowever, the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act (DSA). \nObligations on labeling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament, and the Commission.\n(CONCLUSION)\nAllow me to conclude this brief presentation now.\nGenerative AI has the potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThis poses a threat to our democratic society.\nThe EU is on the frontier of regulating AI technology and is now moving ahead to regulate generative AI.\n(PAUSE)\nI am now ready to answer your questions.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nSpeaking notes for the attention of the Commissioner\nGenerative AI\nScene setter \nOn 10 June 20XX, at 11:15 AM, you will hold a press conference in order to present a dedicated track on disinformation risks presented by generative AI in the context of the EU's Code of Practice against disinformation. This press release follows the meeting with Commissioner Breton and representatives of signatories of the Code of Practice on 9 June 20XX.\nSpeaking points\n- The EU stands at the vanguard of sound regulation of emerging artificial intelligence technology. With the new AI package, the first-ever legal framework on AI, the EU becomes a global leader in this area.\n- Today, we are announcing yet another step towards increased transparency and accountability of AI that will help protect the interests of all European citizens - a new dedicated and separate track to the Code of Practice against disinformation, which we have signed with dozens of the leading tech companies, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, TikTok or Twitch.\n- This track will focus on fight against disinformation created by generative Artificial Intelligence. Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence system capable of generating text, images, or other media in response to prompts from users. These are models that can learn from the patterns and structure of their input training data, and generate new data on this basis.\n- Generative AI offers many benefits for all European citizens, yet brings along risks too. Along with Commissioner Breton, we want to use this initiative to help European citizens and companies reap the benefits of this new technology, rather than stifle it. This is why it will be done on a voluntary basis.\n- Among key benefits of generative AI are increase in operational efficiency and lower labor costs. It can allow European companies to focus on strategic objectives through automation of routine tasks. Industrial uses of generative AI are broad, from healthcare and education, through marketing and finance, all the way to the fight against climate change.\n- However, these benefits can only be put in practice if we can guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses using it. There are a number of very serious risks when it comes to generative AI. Most importantly, generative AI can seriously increase risk of spreading disinformation and pose a serious threat to democracy and EU values. As the so called Deepfakes, or AI-generated images, videos or voice recordings that can affect any one of us. They can also seriously impact election outcomes, be misused by criminals or rogues states, and become threat to democracy. Among other serious dangers are concerns as to data privacy, cybersecurity, infringements of intellectual property rights, or possibly biases against minorities. \n- In a related piece of legislation, the European Commission has already proposed new copyright rules for generative AI which would require companies to disclose any copyrighted material, thus protecting intellectual property rights.\n- In our comprehensive AI Act, we have outlined rules to govern AI technology and a classification of AI tools based on their perceived risk - from unnacceptable, which would entail banning of such AI system, to minimal/no risk, which concerns most AI systems currently used in the EU. Strict obligations will be imposed on the high-risk systems in order to protect EU citizens, companies and security overall. Thus, we will make sure no one is discriminated against based on their race, religion, gender, or other characteristics by an AI system trained on inherently biased historical data.\n- The AI Act aims at protecting our citizens without imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies, thus fostering innovation and boosting the economy at the same time.\n- The initiative I am presenting here today goes in the same direction. Without imposing mandatory restrictions, Commissioner Breton and myself have asked the 40-odd signatories of the EU's Code of Practice against disinformation to come up with specific measures to tackle disinformation risks presented by generative AI.\n- Together, we will formulate a system that will allow us to reap the benefits of generative AI all the while protecting the European citizens from disinformation and\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}

The legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of batteries, from raw material supply chain to production, reuse, and recycling. The proposal aligns with the European Green Deal, Circular Economy Action Plan, and New Industrial Strategy. The Council and European Parliament have reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. An internal reflection and brainstorming meeting is planned to fine-tune the original proposal in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to build a resilient lithium supply chain\n\nSummary: Europe is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for lithium, a key metal used in batteries for electric vehicles. The European Union (EU) plans to release its Critical Raw Materials Act, which will identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk. The EU aims to become climate neutral by 2050 and has set ambitious goals for the electrification of transportation. However, challenges faced by carmakers and concerns about supply availability and access to raw materials continue to impact the growth of the electric vehicle market in Europe.\n\nHeadline: European Commission considers classifying lithium as toxic\n\nSummary: The European Commission is considering a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If approved, this classification could undermine the EU's efforts to create a domestic battery materials supply chain. The EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium for its electric vehicle production sector, and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions. The proposal could have an impact on lithium mining, processing, cathode production, and recycling.\n\nHeadline: The Inflation Reduction Act stimulates battery mineral mining in the US\n\nSummary: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US is expected to stimulate a \"gold rush\" in battery mineral mining, refining, and production. The IRA offers tax credits for various stages of battery production and the battery supply chain, making it more appealing for companies to bring full-cycle battery production to the US. This includes mining and refining battery minerals, producing battery cells, and battery pack production. The IRA aims to reduce the US's dependence on China for battery minerals and increase domestic production.\n\nHeadline: Russia plans to start lithium mining in the next few years\n\nSummary: Russia is planning to start lithium mining based on ore deposits in the Murmansk region within the next three to four years. The country has significant lithium reserves, accounting for 10% of the world's reserves. The demand for lithium is expected to increase in the next decade, and Russia aims to become one of the world's top five producers of lithium. The next stage of Russia's lithium industry development will be the application of technologies for lithium production from solutions found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields.\n\nHeadline: Meeting the growing demand for lithium in the electric vehicle industry\n\nSummary: The demand for lithium is expected to rise significantly due to the growing electric vehicle industry. Despite the expected increase in demand, the lithium industry is expected to provide enough supply to meet the needs of the lithium-ion battery industry. In addition to increasing conventional lithium supply, new technologies such as direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP) offer promise in increasing supply, reducing the industry's environmental impact, and lowering costs. Battery recycling is also expected to increase, providing a secondary supply of lithium.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the Case Study. \nMemo | Regulation on batteries and waste batteries | In December 20XX-2, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on batteries and waste batteries. The proposal aims to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery life cycle. The initiative is closely linked to the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the New Industrial Strategy.  | At the end of last year, The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. For the first time the legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of a battery \u2013 from the supply chain of raw materials, over the production to reuse and recycling of batteries \u2013 and ensure that they are safe, sustainable, and competitive. | The purpose of this memo is to launch the interservice consultation procedure for the new Regulation on Batteries and waste batteries. It is intended to structure the review of the original proposal, considering the observations of the Council and the European Parliament, and to further materialize the specific requirements by setting measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based targets and objectives. |  | Context | The European Union (EU) has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Recently proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035. | As sales of electric vehicles increase, carmakers are looking to secure supply of key metals used in batteries, including lithium. Today, Europe is quite dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply and China for lithium refining. While only around 9% of the world's lithium is mined in China, around 60% is refined there. | With expected battery lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles, and the possibility of extending EV battery life through use in the energy-storage sector, battery recycling is expected to increase during the current decade, but not to game-changing levels. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. By 2030, such secondary supply is expected to account for slightly more than 6 percent of total lithium production. | Although Europe is pushing to build a resilient supply chain by partnering with allies and developing domestic resources, it might not all be good news for miners in the region \u2014 at the end of last year, the European Commission said it will weigh a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, recycling, and handling of the materials.  |  | Agenda | General  | The new regulation should apply to all batteries including all waste portable batteries, electric vehicle batteries, industrial batteries, starting, lightning and ignition batteries, and batteries for light means of transport (e.g., electric bikes, e-mopeds, e-scooters). | Supply chain of raw materials | EU needs to boost its local mining and refining capacity and shift more towards trustworthy suppliers.  | Target for local mining: cover the EU needs for XX% by 20XX+Y.  | Due diligence of raw materials\u2019 origin, carbon intensity requirements and more efficient use of raw materials. Target date: end of 20XX+Y. Possible exemption for SMEs from the due diligence rules (to be discussed). | Refinery: More recycled content in new batteries second life for industrial batteries. Targets for producers to collect waste portable batteries (XX% by the end of 20XX+Y). Introduction of dedicated collection objective for waste batteries for light means of transport (YY% by the end of 20XX+Y). | Market: Promote a circular battery industry, market for secondary raw materials, clearer labelling, and information with \u201cbattery passports\u201d and QR codes | End of use: Strict collection schemes and recycling targets, better ways of re-using old batteries, battery traceability, more efficient recycling of waste batteries, ensure the environmentally sound treatment of waste batteries, incentives for further recycling. | Production of batteries in the EU | 20XX+1: additional investment of \u20acXX billion in R&D for European battery production and electric cars. | Targets: by 20XX+Y Local producers cover the EU's demand and by 20XX+Y, EU produces next generation battery and EV technologies.  | By 20XX+Y, the EU sets a global sustainable standard in the global market. | Functioning of the internal market  | The new rules aim to improve the functioning of the internal market for batteries and ensure fairer competition. This will be reached through performance, durability and safety criteria, tight restrictions for hazardous substances like mercury, cadmium and lead and mandatory information on the carbon footprint of batteries. The regulation also introduces labelling and information requirements, among other things on the battery's components and recycled content, and an electronic \u201cbattery passport\u201d and a QR code. | Setting of a realistic implementation schedule.\u00a0Notably, labelling requirements will apply after XX months after entry into force of the Regulation and after XX months for the QR code. |  |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nIn the light of the upcoming surge of the demand of electric vehicles (EV), an even greater increase is expected in the industry of EV batteries and especially in the demand of lithium, which is a key chemical component of them. Demand is expected to increase by 500% until 2030, affecting its price accordingly, forcing EU to be dependable on imports due to the fact that no lithium processing or refining takes place within its territory.\nEU's intention to fully detach from Chinese-owned supply across all stages of the lithium-ion supply chain may prove impossible but it is expected to improve in the next decades. Thus, directly prohibiting supplies from Chinese-owned companies is not advisable due to the fact that China has a multi-year advantage over the rest of the world in terms of investment, know-how, processing equipment and resources.\nYet, it is imperative that the EU should take measures in order to remain competitive in the approximate future. Considering that the other main players, such us the USA, Russia and Canada have already started implementing policies aiming to decrease their dependancy for EV battery components from China or boost their own industries, EU has to take action. Specifically, the EU could examine strategies such as:\n- Subsidise companies in the industry of lithium extraction and processing that could possibly use new technologies (more efficient or enviroment friendly) to extract the mineral. Technologies such as DLE and DLP may prove a good investment in order for the EU to match the demand of lithium in the near future.\n- Incentivise companies that are already active in similar industries to invest in lithium extraction and processing as well or to examine whether some of their byproducts can be refined to be used as EV battery components.\n- Offer tax credits for companies in the lithium industry, as a countermeasure to the US IRA.\n- Negotiatie long term trade agreements with main producers such as Australia, Chile or Argentina as an attempt to control prices of imported lithium and thus retain a competitve advantage for its companies.\n Additionally, and in order to avoid a gradual exit of big EV manufacturers from EU, classifying lithium derivatives as dangerous will complicate the import procedure, production and handling of the materials, further increasing costs. In order to deal with the ECHA proposal concerning the toxicity of certain lithium salts, the EU could incentivise companies to adopt controls that will ensure that said chemicals are not hazardous for the public health.\n In conclusion, the sharply increasing trend in demand and consequently in prices of EV battery components will force the EU to implement specific measures in order to remain competitive. It has to regulate lithium imports in order to control the price, decrease dependancy from China and boost its own industry since EVs are a crucial factor when it comes to the transition to a greener economy.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 6.8\n\n"}

If approved, this classification could undermine the EU's efforts to create a domestic battery materials supply chain. The EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium for its electric vehicle production sector, and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions. The proposal could have an impact on lithium mining, processing, cathode production, and recycling.\n\nHeadline: The Inflation Reduction Act stimulates battery mineral mining in the US\n\nSummary: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US is expected to stimulate a \"gold rush\" in battery mineral mining, refining, and production. The IRA offers tax credits for various stages of battery production and the battery supply chain, making it more appealing for companies to bring full-cycle battery production to the US. This includes mining and refining battery minerals, producing battery cells, and battery pack production. The IRA aims to reduce the US's dependence on China for battery minerals and increase domestic production.\n\nHeadline: Russia plans to start lithium mining in the next few years\n\nSummary: Russia is planning to start lithium mining based on ore deposits in the Murmansk region within the next three to four years. The country has significant lithium reserves, accounting for 10% of the world's reserves. The demand for lithium is expected to increase in the next decade, and Russia aims to become one of the world's top five producers of lithium. The next stage of Russia's lithium industry development will be the application of technologies for lithium production from solutions found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields.\n\nHeadline: Meeting the growing demand for lithium in the electric vehicle industry\n\nSummary: The demand for lithium is expected to rise significantly due to the growing electric vehicle industry. Despite the expected increase in demand, the lithium industry is expected to provide enough supply to meet the needs of the lithium-ion battery industry. In addition to increasing conventional lithium supply, new technologies such as direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP) offer promise in increasing supply, reducing the industry's environmental impact, and lowering costs. Battery recycling is also expected to increase, providing a secondary supply of lithium.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the Case Study. \nMemo | Regulation on batteries and waste batteries | In December 20XX-2, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on batteries and waste batteries. The proposal aims to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery life cycle. The initiative is closely linked to the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the New Industrial Strategy.  | At the end of last year, The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. For the first time the legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of a battery \u2013 from the supply chain of raw materials, over the production to reuse and recycling of batteries \u2013 and ensure that they are safe, sustainable, and competitive. | The purpose of this memo is to launch the interservice consultation procedure for the new Regulation on Batteries and waste batteries. It is intended to structure the review of the original proposal, considering the observations of the Council and the European Parliament, and to further materialize the specific requirements by setting measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based targets and objectives. |  | Context | The European Union (EU) has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Recently proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035. | As sales of electric vehicles increase, carmakers are looking to secure supply of key metals used in batteries, including lithium. Today, Europe is quite dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply and China for lithium refining. While only around 9% of the world's lithium is mined in China, around 60% is refined there. | With expected battery lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles, and the possibility of extending EV battery life through use in the energy-storage sector, battery recycling is expected to increase during the current decade, but not to game-changing levels. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. By 2030, such secondary supply is expected to account for slightly more than 6 percent of total lithium production. | Although Europe is pushing to build a resilient supply chain by partnering with allies and developing domestic resources, it might not all be good news for miners in the region \u2014 at the end of last year, the European Commission said it will weigh a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, recycling, and handling of the materials.  |  | Agenda | General  | The new regulation should apply to all batteries including all waste portable batteries, electric vehicle batteries, industrial batteries, starting, lightning and ignition batteries, and batteries for light means of transport (e.g., electric bikes, e-mopeds, e-scooters). | Supply chain of raw materials | EU needs to boost its local mining and refining capacity and shift more towards trustworthy suppliers.  | Target for local mining: cover the EU needs for XX% by 20XX+Y.  | Due diligence of raw materials\u2019 origin, carbon intensity requirements and more efficient use of raw materials. Target date: end of 20XX+Y. Possible exemption for SMEs from the due diligence rules (to be discussed). | Refinery: More recycled content in new batteries second life for industrial batteries. Targets for producers to collect waste portable batteries (XX% by the end of 20XX+Y). Introduction of dedicated collection objective for waste batteries for light means of transport (YY% by the end of 20XX+Y). | Market: Promote a circular battery industry, market for secondary raw materials, clearer labelling, and information with \u201cbattery passports\u201d and QR codes | End of use: Strict collection schemes and recycling targets, better ways of re-using old batteries, battery traceability, more efficient recycling of waste batteries, ensure the environmentally sound treatment of waste batteries, incentives for further recycling. | Production of batteries in the EU | 20XX+1: additional investment of \u20acXX billion in R&D for European battery production and electric cars. | Targets: by 20XX+Y Local producers cover the EU's demand and by 20XX+Y, EU produces next generation battery and EV technologies.  | By 20XX+Y, the EU sets a global sustainable standard in the global market. | Functioning of the internal market  | The new rules aim to improve the functioning of the internal market for batteries and ensure fairer competition. This will be reached through performance, durability and safety criteria, tight restrictions for hazardous substances like mercury, cadmium and lead and mandatory information on the carbon footprint of batteries. The regulation also introduces labelling and information requirements, among other things on the battery's components and recycled content, and an electronic \u201cbattery passport\u201d and a QR code. | Setting of a realistic implementation schedule.\u00a0Notably, labelling requirements will apply after XX months after entry into force of the Regulation and after XX months for the QR code. |  |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nInternal memo\nfor the EC DG MOVE meeting on fine-tuning\n\"Critical Raw Material Act\"\nStatus\nCritical Raw Material Act aims to identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk. The legislation regulates for the first time the entire life cycle of a battery and ensure they are safe, sustainable, and competitve. Our DG has the lead on this file.\nThe EU has goals to become climate neutral by 2050, while banning all internal combustion engine cars by 2035. Although the EV demand is thriving, the car market is expected to shrink for a second year in a row making it difficult to achieve the goal. The industry expects the Raw Material Act EU to secure supply of key materials used in batteries, including lithium where Europe is dependent on Australia and Chile for supply and China for refining.\nNew data after the proposal of the Raw Material Act:\n- ECHA accepted the demand from France to classify lithium salts as dangerous for human health and the Commission is considering to adopt the Agency's proposal. If put in effect, the supply chain and the production of EV batteries is expected to increase dramatically, making existing investment plans non-feasible. Already, there are voices within the industry to abandon such projects in Germany and put in jeopardy new plants in Serbia and Portugal.\n- The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in the USA incentives every stage of battery production and battery supply chain. The incentives per production stage and per material are cumulative and it is expected to stimulate a series of investments on USA soil. This puts at risk already made decision to invest on EU countries. Already automotive companies (i.e. Tesla) declare their intention to cut EU project in favor of production capacity in the USA.\n- EU decision to reduce China dependency risk. On the other hand, as the President of the European Commission said, EU needs to boost its production capacity and move towards trustworthy suppliers.\n- New technologies (uncertainty on future demand). At the same time, new technologies present risks and opportunities. Foe example, there are many uncertainties around how the battery market will affect future lithium demand. Also, there are lithium mining  technologies under development (in Russia that expects to become a top 5 lithium producers in the next 10 years) that are more environmentally friendly and better efficiency.\n \nAgenda\n- Critical Raw Material Act - Main points nad current status\n- New data after the provisional political agreement between the European Parliament and the Council\n- EV demand\n- Financial situation\n- ECHA proposal\n- New technologies\n- Situation in other countries\n- USA and the IRA\n- China & Russia\n- Discussion\n- Conclusion (action plan)\n \nRecommendations to fine-tune original proposal\n- Explore possible solutions to environmental concerns (ECHA proposal)\n- Incentives to reduce financial risks\n- R&D programs/Incentives for new lithium extraction technologies\n- Ways to make automobile manufacturers to stay in the EU and spark further investments in supply chain and lithium batteries production\n- Ways to strengthen collaboration with other lithium producers to reduce exposure to China\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 5.0\n\n"}

She assured that industry interests will not dominate the decision-making process and that the strong message from European citizens regarding animal rights and welfare will be respected.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \n\nIntroduction and background\nThis briefing note summarises the main remaining issues in the preparation of our draft proposal for the revised animal welfare regulation. Following the impact assessment concluded last year, a legislative proposal has been prepared and the inter-service consultation was recently concluded. We received positive opinions except for one negative opinion from DG AGRI, setting a condition regarding the preferred option for banning cages for laying hens.\n\nMain issues\nThe legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: \nrestricting the use of cages/crates;\nending the killing of day-old male chickens;\nbanning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and\nsetting animal welfare requirements at import.\n\nThe legislative proposal is based on the medium or high ambition option for all these measures. The cost-benefit analysis from the impact assessment showed that this would be the most efficient way forward. It is also in line with the outcomes of our stakeholder consultations and pressure from citizens. \n\nOther DGs support our draft proposal except when it comes to the ban on cages for laying hens. DG AGRI are concerned about the risk of unfair competition and raised food prices as a result of a cage ban. They therefore issued a negative opinion in the inter-service consultation. DG AGRI wants to see the low-ambition option (phase-in of a cage ban over 12 years) or even no legislative change at all, whereas the DG SANTE preferred option is the high-ambition option with phase-in over 5 years and no exceptions made. We would also like to see the ban combined with space requirements to ensure that free-range hens have sufficient living area. Sufficient space per animal is also needed for health and safety reasons including to minimise the risk of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nIt is true that this high-ambition option would have an impact on food pricing, though our impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. The main limitation is that poultry farmers will be able to house fewer birds per square meter. To some extent, farmers could be compensated for this via the Common Agricultural Policy or other economic incentives.\n\nFor small farmers, this seems not to be a main issue, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. In several Member States, the cage ban will also make no difference as they already adopted a ban within their national legislation. For internal market purposes, a cage ban would therefore help create a more level playing field.\n\nA more important problem is the competition with imported goods from third countries. This seems to be the real core concern of DG AGRI. Among our proposed options, we did propose to require stricter animal welfare rules also for imported animals and animal products, though our impact assessment implied that the medium ambition option would be the most cost-efficient choice.\n\nOptions for the way forward\nThere seems to be two main options for the way forward: compromise on the cage ban or compromise on the import rules.\n\nA compromise on the cage ban for laying hens would mean abandonning our preferred option to settle at the low or medium options instead. This would still be an improvement compared to the current situation. However, it is likely that the Commission would then be heavily criticised by NGOs as well as by the European Parliament who called for a total ban in shorter time. \n\nThe other possibility would be to focus instead on the real underlying problem raised by DG AGRI: the risk of unfair competition from third countries. DG AGRI have indicated that the transition time and exceptions for small farms are not the real problem, so a compromise solution on the cage ban proposal is not necessarily in their best interest. We could instead try to convince them to change their current position and accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages, in exchange for instead increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).\n\nThis would however require another round of talks also with DG TRADE who gave a positive opinion in the inter-service consultation. We have no information about their willingness to agree to such a compromise.\n\nConclusion\nOur recommendation is to, as a first priority, seek a compromise with DG AGRI based on stricter import rules. This would address their main concern while not compromising our preferred options or lowering the level of ambition for animal welfare.\n\nIf this fails, the fallback option could be to strike a compromise based on a longer phase-in period of the cage ban (low or medium ambition option).\n\nIf you agree to this plan of action, we can start informally consulting DG AGRI and DG TRADE immediately\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n1) Introduction \nFollowing the \"End the Cage Age\" European citizens initiative, submitted on 2 October 202X-3, after gathering 1,397,113 statements of support, the European Parliament has called for the end of cage farming within the next five years. \nIn response to this, the European Commission, on the 4 April 202X, committed to table a legislative proposal to phase out, and finally prohibit, cage systems usage for all animals in the initiative. However, it is important to facilitate a balanced and economically viable transition to cage-free farming, particularly by adopting specific supporting measures in key policy areas areas like trade and research and development. \n2) Animal welfare regulation state of play and main issues \n2.1) State of play of Inter-Service Consultation (ISG) replies: \nDG TRADE and DG ENV provided green light to the draft legislation revision proposal of DG SANTE. On the other hand, DG AGRI blocked the proposal, claiming a series of policy problems that need to be tackled. \n2.2) DG AGRI main opposition motives:\nDG AGRI reasons for blocking the proposal are the following:\n1) The proposed exception for farms with less than 50 livestock units (3500 laying hens) is not rational. In fact, the large majority of eggs produced in the EU come from farms with more than 5000 birds (70 livestock units) and the smaller farms have already a more easily transition to cage-free rearing if they have not done it; \n2) The legislation has focuses too extensively on money and food prices rather than providing longer transition times; \n3) The proposal of having more space for laying hens as requirement is a less cost-efficient solution, which will lead most farms not being able to maintain the same number of birds;\n4) Finally, the price for eggs by implementing DG SANTE new proposed regulation might increase by 20-40%, in countries where cage systems are the norm (i.e. Spain, Portugal and Malta), impacting more significantly the poorest family and resulting in higher imports of cheaper eggs from third countries with worse animal welfare standards.  \nIn light of the above, DG AGRI would opt for a longer transition period or maintaining the current status quo. \n2.3) Scientific evidence on non-cage housing systems\nMoreover, alongside the above-mentioned policy issues, several scientific studies highlighted several public health concerns in regards to the implementation of non-cage housing systems: \n1) The usage of non-cage housin systems for poultry can result in a higher level of antimicrobial resistance prevalence, notably among e-coli bacteria, if the implementation process is not correct and does not follow strict quality standards; \n2) Free-range egg production systems face more challenges in relation to biosecurity and antibiotics usage. In fact, the free-range layer birds interact more with each other in comparison to the ones in cages, increasing the incidence of infectious poultry diseases requiring treatment with antimicrobials, thus resulting in increased emergence of resistant commensal and pathogenic bacteria (major threat to public health). \n2.4) Main factors to consider for an efficient non-cage system:\nTo implement an efficient non-cage system, is necessary particular attention on the specific aspects:\n1) Number of hens per square meter; \n2) Hygiene routines; \n3) Overall rules on veterinary antiobiotics' prescription. \nThe same problems aforementioned apply to pigs farming practices. \n3) An assessment of the available policy options:\n3.1) Three main possible scenarios:\nFor adopting a transition phase to cage-free systems, respectively high, medium and low ambition policies may be considered. The high ambition policy provides the quickest transition phase, but it may result in higher burden of cost for farmers and generally have a regressive impact on the poorest households. On the other hand, the low ambition period, providing a transition phase of 10 years, would give farmers the largest span of time to adjust to the policy change, but it is not line with the expectations of both the European Parliament and the European civil society. \nAs concerns the medium ambition policy scenario, it looks the most reasonable solution, from a cost- and time perspective. \n3.2) The medium ambition policy scenario implementation: \nIn detail, the medium policy ambition scenario would entail the following measures: \n1) For crates / cages (pig): Phase in of the ban over 5 years. Farms with less than 50 livestock units will be allowed to phase out over 15 years. Allowing temporay confinement from 1 day before farrowing to 5 days post-farrowing. \n2) For calves, phase-out of all use of crates within 5 years. Moreover, a ban on trade / import of calves must be created. \n3) For laying hends and pullets a total ban should be phased in over 5 years.\n4) For rabbits and animal in fur production a transition phase of 5 years will be put in place.\n5) For killing day-old male chickens, ban of procedure within 10 years alongside providing economic incentives through the Common Agricultural Policy for farmers transition sooner. Alongside this, an obligation to mark eggs eggs from production systems not yet transitioned will be put in place.\n6) For the painful mutilations ban, a phase in over 10 years will be granted.\n7) Finally, the requirements for import from third countries should be in line with the minimum set of rules for welfare implemented by the EU. \n4) Policy recommendation \n4.1) The importance of transition\nThe EU should  provide financial incentives to farmers through the Common Agricultural Policy for farmers in order to make the burden of shifting to non-cage systems the less expensive and impactful on their activity as possible. \n4.2) The importance of innovation: \nThe EU should consider the most recent technological developments in agricultural practices, zooechnics and transport operation, by understanding better stocking densities, behaviour (for enriched environment), mutilation practices, journey times and space allowances for animals transports.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 6.0\n\n"}

The legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of batteries, from raw material supply chain to production, reuse, and recycling. The proposal aligns with the European Green Deal, Circular Economy Action Plan, and New Industrial Strategy. The Council and European Parliament have reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. An internal reflection and brainstorming meeting is planned to fine-tune the original proposal in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to build a resilient lithium supply chain\n\nSummary: Europe is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for lithium, a key metal used in batteries for electric vehicles. The European Union (EU) plans to release its Critical Raw Materials Act, which will identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk. The EU aims to become climate neutral by 2050 and has set ambitious goals for the electrification of transportation. However, challenges faced by carmakers and concerns about supply availability and access to raw materials continue to impact the growth of the electric vehicle market in Europe.\n\nHeadline: European Commission considers classifying lithium as toxic\n\nSummary: The European Commission is considering a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If approved, this classification could undermine the EU's efforts to create a domestic battery materials supply chain. The EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium for its electric vehicle production sector, and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions. The proposal could have an impact on lithium mining, processing, cathode production, and recycling.\n\nHeadline: The Inflation Reduction Act stimulates battery mineral mining in the US\n\nSummary: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US is expected to stimulate a \"gold rush\" in battery mineral mining, refining, and production. The IRA offers tax credits for various stages of battery production and the battery supply chain, making it more appealing for companies to bring full-cycle battery production to the US. This includes mining and refining battery minerals, producing battery cells, and battery pack production. The IRA aims to reduce the US's dependence on China for battery minerals and increase domestic production.\n\nHeadline: Russia plans to start lithium mining in the next few years\n\nSummary: Russia is planning to start lithium mining based on ore deposits in the Murmansk region within the next three to four years. The country has significant lithium reserves, accounting for 10% of the world's reserves. The demand for lithium is expected to increase in the next decade, and Russia aims to become one of the world's top five producers of lithium. The next stage of Russia's lithium industry development will be the application of technologies for lithium production from solutions found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields.\n\nHeadline: Meeting the growing demand for lithium in the electric vehicle industry\n\nSummary: The demand for lithium is expected to rise significantly due to the growing electric vehicle industry. Despite the expected increase in demand, the lithium industry is expected to provide enough supply to meet the needs of the lithium-ion battery industry. In addition to increasing conventional lithium supply, new technologies such as direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP) offer promise in increasing supply, reducing the industry's environmental impact, and lowering costs. Battery recycling is also expected to increase, providing a secondary supply of lithium.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the Case Study. \nMemo | Regulation on batteries and waste batteries | In December 20XX-2, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on batteries and waste batteries. The proposal aims to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery life cycle. The initiative is closely linked to the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the New Industrial Strategy.  | At the end of last year, The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. For the first time the legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of a battery \u2013 from the supply chain of raw materials, over the production to reuse and recycling of batteries \u2013 and ensure that they are safe, sustainable, and competitive. | The purpose of this memo is to launch the interservice consultation procedure for the new Regulation on Batteries and waste batteries. It is intended to structure the review of the original proposal, considering the observations of the Council and the European Parliament, and to further materialize the specific requirements by setting measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based targets and objectives. |  | Context | The European Union (EU) has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Recently proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035. | As sales of electric vehicles increase, carmakers are looking to secure supply of key metals used in batteries, including lithium. Today, Europe is quite dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply and China for lithium refining. While only around 9% of the world's lithium is mined in China, around 60% is refined there. | With expected battery lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles, and the possibility of extending EV battery life through use in the energy-storage sector, battery recycling is expected to increase during the current decade, but not to game-changing levels. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. By 2030, such secondary supply is expected to account for slightly more than 6 percent of total lithium production. | Although Europe is pushing to build a resilient supply chain by partnering with allies and developing domestic resources, it might not all be good news for miners in the region \u2014 at the end of last year, the European Commission said it will weigh a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, recycling, and handling of the materials.  |  | Agenda | General  | The new regulation should apply to all batteries including all waste portable batteries, electric vehicle batteries, industrial batteries, starting, lightning and ignition batteries, and batteries for light means of transport (e.g., electric bikes, e-mopeds, e-scooters). | Supply chain of raw materials | EU needs to boost its local mining and refining capacity and shift more towards trustworthy suppliers.  | Target for local mining: cover the EU needs for XX% by 20XX+Y.  | Due diligence of raw materials\u2019 origin, carbon intensity requirements and more efficient use of raw materials. Target date: end of 20XX+Y. Possible exemption for SMEs from the due diligence rules (to be discussed). | Refinery: More recycled content in new batteries second life for industrial batteries. Targets for producers to collect waste portable batteries (XX% by the end of 20XX+Y). Introduction of dedicated collection objective for waste batteries for light means of transport (YY% by the end of 20XX+Y). | Market: Promote a circular battery industry, market for secondary raw materials, clearer labelling, and information with \u201cbattery passports\u201d and QR codes | End of use: Strict collection schemes and recycling targets, better ways of re-using old batteries, battery traceability, more efficient recycling of waste batteries, ensure the environmentally sound treatment of waste batteries, incentives for further recycling. | Production of batteries in the EU | 20XX+1: additional investment of \u20acXX billion in R&D for European battery production and electric cars. | Targets: by 20XX+Y Local producers cover the EU's demand and by 20XX+Y, EU produces next generation battery and EV technologies.  | By 20XX+Y, the EU sets a global sustainable standard in the global market. | Functioning of the internal market  | The new rules aim to improve the functioning of the internal market for batteries and ensure fairer competition.

INTRODUCCTION\nThe european union has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.In fact, recently EU proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035. \nIn 202x-2 electric car registrations for the year were 1.729.000, 60% up from 2020. \nThe administrtion in Brussels has been making ist environmetal and climate rules stricter for decades. the EU wants to make the entire continent carbon neutral by mid century. At the same time, it is etriving to achieve the highest level of protection from pollution in the world. Favourishing electric cars industry is an important point to manage its targets.\n \n2. POINTS IN\nDespite expectations that litium demand will rise from aproximately 500.000 metric tons of tithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2021, to some 3 or 4 million metric tons in 2030, it is expected that the lithium industry will be able to porvide enough product to supply the burgeoning tithioum-ion battery industry. \nIt is important to remark that the possibility of extending Electric vehicle battery life through use in the energy storage sector. Also it is important pay attention that battery recicling is expected to increase during the current decade. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in the end-life batteries.\n \n3. POINTS OUT\nThe energy transition and the decarbonization of industrial activity and power plants imply massive deployment of renovables, mostly solar and wind farms. However, as they depend on unstable weather conditions, the electric power system requires energy storage, in which the EU counts a lot on batteries.\nThe EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium to supply its electric vehicle production sector and the classification of lithium as toxic may increase its reliance on other regions, at a time when the Union is focused on energy security and reducing emissions.\nThe Eu has  added lithium to a list of critical raw materials as demand is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years. Adding lithium salts to the list of materials hazardous for the health may propt re revision of a range of projets in the industry.\nOthe point to study is that lithium reclycling is stills small scale although it it could reach 6 percent of announced supply by 2030.\n \n4. PROPOSALS\nIt is fundamental, to emphasize the economic key point. \nOffering cash money (tax credits) all the steps in the lithium electric car batteries production, for mining battery minerals, refining them, putting together battery cells and for putting together battery packs (or modules), could be essential to reduce the dependence of Asia and America.\nWorking on the investigation to increase recycling industry related to lithium form used electric car batterys must be actively favourised thought founding mechanismes.\n \n5. PRIORITIES OF THE CO-LEGISTATORS\nThe European Union is working in a very complicated environment. Not only war in Ucrania has obliged to review the economic expectations, but also the increasing prices of imported materials from China, important inputs for european indlustry.\nIt is important that Co-legislators create new founding squemes to favourise the electric car industry and also the reclycling industry favourising the study of reclycliong process of lithium batteries. It will be a hard work for Science, Environtment and industry Ministrys, which have to work in a same direction, becoming climate neutral by 2050.\n \n6. CONCLUSION\nThere is a lot of work to do but our indicators show that the EU runs in a good way. Our DG needs to work listening the needs of european citizens and Move industries, proposing founds and financial help conditions, managing the industrial deveolepment and the resilience.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 5.5\n\n"}

Commission VP for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton met with representatives of these organizations to discuss the issue. Jourov\u00e1 will present her initiative at a press point, emphasizing the importance of fighting disinformation in the context of defending democracy and EU values.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: The Most Pressing Dangers of AI\n\nSummary: AI systems pose various risks and dangers that need to be addressed. These include techno-solutionism, which views AI as a panacea and can lead to larger problems; the adoption of a statistical perspective on justice, which can result in biased outcomes; the potential for disinformation and threats to democracy through AI manipulation; discrimination and risk in the medical setting; and the risks associated with generative AI, such as deepfakes and the spread of misinformation. The European Commission is proposing a regulatory framework on AI to address these risks and ensure the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses. Additionally, the EU is pushing for AI labels to identify AI-generated content and fight against deepfakes and disinformation.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \nPress point by Commission VP Jourova on generative AI\n10th of June 20XX at 11:15 \u2013 Charlemagne building (Room TBD) \n(INTRODUCTION)\nGood morning.\nWe are living in a Brave New World.\nGenerative AI is making breathtaking advances \u2014 from writing texts to creating ever more realistic pictures and videos.\nOver these last months we have been baffled by the exploits of ChatGTP and DALL.E, to the point that many of us in this room are fearing for their job in a not-so-distant future.\nBut there is more: generative AI will have enormous consequences not just for the future of our work, but for society, politics, and democracy. \nYesterday, Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton and myself have met representatives of 40-odd companies and organizations that have signed up to the EU\u2019s Code of Practice against disinformation. \nWe have asked them to come up with a clear labelling system to identify AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation. \nThe Commission wants to prevent artificial intelligence from blurring the lines between fact and fiction.\nToday, I would like to put this initiative in its wider context for you.\n(PAUSE)\n(WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI)\nNow, what exactly is generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\nGenerative AI generates outputs that appear authentic and human-like: text, images, graphics, music, etc.\nGenerative AI algorithms learn from training data that include examples of the desired output. \nBased on the patterns and structures within the training data, generative AI models can produce new content that shares characteristics with the original input data. \nThe most compelling advantage generative AI proposes is that it enables businesses to automate specific tasks and focus time, energy, and resources on more important strategic objectives:\nFor example, in content creation, generative AI can produce text, images and even music, assisting marketers, journalists, and artists with their creative processes. \nIn customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can provide more personalized assistance and reduce response times.\nGenerative AI is used in medicine to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs, saving time and money in research. \n\n(PAUSE)\n\n(THE DANGERS OF GENERATIVE AI)\nHowever, generative AI presents numerous issues requiring attention. \nOne major concern is its potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThe technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage. \nDisinformation poses serious threats to society, as it effectively changes and manipulates evidence to create social feedback loops that undermine any sense of objective truth. \nAI systems used to spread disinformation on the internet, can become a threat to society, politics, and democracy. \n(PAUSE)\n\n(LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON AI)\nSome two years ago, the European Commission began drafting the first-ever legal framework on AI, addressing the risks of AI and positioning Europe to play a leading role globally. \nA couple of weeks ago, this new Legal Framework on AI entered the co-decision stage. \nUnder the proposals, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level: from minimal through to limited, high, and unacceptable. \nWhile high-risk tools will not be banned, those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations.\nClearly, many generative AI systems belong in the high-risk category.\n(PAUSE)\n(NEW RULES FOR GENERATIVE AI)\nLast April, the European Union proposed new copyright rules for generative AI.\nCompanies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney, will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems.\nSome committee members initially proposed banning copyrighted material being used to train generative AI models altogether, but this was abandoned in favour of a transparency requirement.\nClear Labels. Services with a potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation should put in place technology to recognize such content and clearly label this to users. \nThe label should apply to all AI-generated material that can be used to create disinformation, including text, images, audio, and video.\nOn the other hand, services that integrate generative AI like Bingchat for Microsoft, Bard for Google should build in necessary safeguards that these services cannot be used by malicious actors to generate disinformation.\nFor now, labelling wouldn\u2019t be mandatory, given that it would be part of the voluntary Code of Practice. \nHowever, the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act (DSA). \nObligations on labeling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament, and the Commission.\n(CONCLUSION)\nAllow me to conclude this brief presentation now.\nGenerative AI has the potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThis poses a threat to our democratic society.\nThe EU is on the frontier of regulating AI technology and is now moving ahead to regulate generative AI.\n(PAUSE)\nI am now ready to answer your questions.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nSCENE SETTER\nThe speech aims to inform the press about the Commission initiative in cooperation with 40 organizations that have signed up to the EU Code of Practice against disinformation to create a dedicated section in the Code to deal with disinformation generated by artificial intelligence (AI). \n \nSPEAKING POINTS\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our daily lives. It can be used to create enormous benefits, create solutions to problems that could not be resolved before, help us by making our lives more convenient. It can be used for entertainment to pass time and have fun. However, AI can also be used to create harm. \nOne of the main threats by AI tools that can generate text, photos, videos is disinformation. Fake information that can be polished to level that differentiating it from the truth becomes difficult even to the professionals. Disinformation at the hands of extremists, criminals, some special groups can manipulate the people to create distrust, uncertainties, support for illegal activities undermining cohesion and inclusion of our societies. \nThe Commission has taken a number of steps to address various aspects of the use of artificial intelligence. The European Commission proposed in 20XX the first in the world legislative measure the AI Act to provide AI developers, deployers and users with clear requirements based on specific uses of AI. At the core of the new legal framework currently discussed by the co-legislators is to guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses when it comes to AI.  \nWe have recently also proposed the new copyright rules for generative AI to protect the intellectual property rights of the authors whose content has been used in developing GAI tools and to provide for  increased transparency and ethics in relation to AI.\nAs the most recent initiative, i would like to announce today the cooperative effort between the EU and 40 organisations that have signed up to the EU Code of Practice against disinformation. With the support from these partners, we will create a designated section in the Code on specific disinformation risks presented by generative AI and appropriate measures to address them. \nWe aim at companies working together with us to take necessary safeguards that these services cannot be used to generate malicious disinformation. For example, the content that is created with generative AI must be labeled as such. \nAI, and specifically generative AI are novel developments. We must support the need to innovate, to develop new technical tools to improve our lives. At the same time, we need to be aware of the risks in relation to these new developments and be properly equipped to address these novel risks in sufficient and timely manner. \nI firmly believe that only in close cooperation between the EU, Member States authorities and partners from private sector and civil society we will find this careful balance that would benefit the EU, our values and way of life. \n \nBACKGROUND\nDescription\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GAI) is a sub-field of AI in which algorithms are used to generate new outputs that resemble human-created content, e.g. text, images, music, videos, coputer code, etc based on existing available data. GAI uses machine learning to assess the training materials and patterns, links therein. GAI is constantly improving by self-learning and as a result, the level of quality (similarity to human-created content) increases over time and use. Currently, there exists a number of widely used GAIs, for example ChatGPT to create text on any topic, Midjourney to create images based on textual input.     \nBenefits\nGAI can be made use of in various domains. The more basic use-cases can range from content creation, for example generating ideas, designs, draft essays or articles, to freeing human resources from standard workflows, e.g. by using GAI as virtual assistants or chat bots to reply to clients' frequently asked questions. GAI can also speed up research in medical sector (testing of novel medicines), finance (detecting patterns and predict trends), climate (stimulation and prediction of weather and climate patterns). \nDangers\nThe use of GAI is associated with a number of negative issues that require close attention:\n1. Misinformation or malicious/sensitive content\n2. Copyright issues - misuse and infringement of intellectual property. \n3. Cybersecurity - attackers can use GAI for easier malicious code generation\n4. Social impact - the automation of tasks by GAI can affect workforce requiring impacted emlpoyees to reskil lor upskill.\n \nEU action\n1. The Commission proposal for the AI Act\n2. Proposal on new rules on copyright - requiring companies deploying generative AI tools to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 8.0\n\n"}

Commission VP for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton met with representatives of these organizations to discuss the issue. Jourov\u00e1 will present her initiative at a press point, emphasizing the importance of fighting disinformation in the context of defending democracy and EU values.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: The Most Pressing Dangers of AI\n\nSummary: AI systems pose various risks and dangers that need to be addressed. These include techno-solutionism, which views AI as a panacea and can lead to larger problems; the adoption of a statistical perspective on justice, which can result in biased outcomes; the potential for disinformation and threats to democracy through AI manipulation; discrimination and risk in the medical setting; and the risks associated with generative AI, such as deepfakes and the spread of misinformation. The European Commission is proposing a regulatory framework on AI to address these risks and ensure the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses. Additionally, the EU is pushing for AI labels to identify AI-generated content and fight against deepfakes and disinformation.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \nPress point by Commission VP Jourova on generative AI\n10th of June 20XX at 11:15 \u2013 Charlemagne building (Room TBD) \n(INTRODUCTION)\nGood morning.\nWe are living in a Brave New World.\nGenerative AI is making breathtaking advances \u2014 from writing texts to creating ever more realistic pictures and videos.\nOver these last months we have been baffled by the exploits of ChatGTP and DALL.E, to the point that many of us in this room are fearing for their job in a not-so-distant future.\nBut there is more: generative AI will have enormous consequences not just for the future of our work, but for society, politics, and democracy. \nYesterday, Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton and myself have met representatives of 40-odd companies and organizations that have signed up to the EU\u2019s Code of Practice against disinformation. \nWe have asked them to come up with a clear labelling system to identify AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation. \nThe Commission wants to prevent artificial intelligence from blurring the lines between fact and fiction.\nToday, I would like to put this initiative in its wider context for you.\n(PAUSE)\n(WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI)\nNow, what exactly is generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\nGenerative AI generates outputs that appear authentic and human-like: text, images, graphics, music, etc.\nGenerative AI algorithms learn from training data that include examples of the desired output. \nBased on the patterns and structures within the training data, generative AI models can produce new content that shares characteristics with the original input data. \nThe most compelling advantage generative AI proposes is that it enables businesses to automate specific tasks and focus time, energy, and resources on more important strategic objectives:\nFor example, in content creation, generative AI can produce text, images and even music, assisting marketers, journalists, and artists with their creative processes. \nIn customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can provide more personalized assistance and reduce response times.\nGenerative AI is used in medicine to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs, saving time and money in research. \n\n(PAUSE)\n\n(THE DANGERS OF GENERATIVE AI)\nHowever, generative AI presents numerous issues requiring attention. \nOne major concern is its potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThe technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage. \nDisinformation poses serious threats to society, as it effectively changes and manipulates evidence to create social feedback loops that undermine any sense of objective truth. \nAI systems used to spread disinformation on the internet, can become a threat to society, politics, and democracy. \n(PAUSE)\n\n(LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON AI)\nSome two years ago, the European Commission began drafting the first-ever legal framework on AI, addressing the risks of AI and positioning Europe to play a leading role globally. \nA couple of weeks ago, this new Legal Framework on AI entered the co-decision stage. \nUnder the proposals, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level: from minimal through to limited, high, and unacceptable. \nWhile high-risk tools will not be banned, those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations.\nClearly, many generative AI systems belong in the high-risk category.\n(PAUSE)\n(NEW RULES FOR GENERATIVE AI)\nLast April, the European Union proposed new copyright rules for generative AI.\nCompanies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney, will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems.\nSome committee members initially proposed banning copyrighted material being used to train generative AI models altogether, but this was abandoned in favour of a transparency requirement.\nClear Labels. Services with a potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation should put in place technology to recognize such content and clearly label this to users. \nThe label should apply to all AI-generated material that can be used to create disinformation, including text, images, audio, and video.\nOn the other hand, services that integrate generative AI like Bingchat for Microsoft, Bard for Google should build in necessary safeguards that these services cannot be used by malicious actors to generate disinformation.\nFor now, labelling wouldn\u2019t be mandatory, given that it would be part of the voluntary Code of Practice. \nHowever, the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act (DSA). \nObligations on labeling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament, and the Commission.\n(CONCLUSION)\nAllow me to conclude this brief presentation now.\nGenerative AI has the potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThis poses a threat to our democratic society.\nThe EU is on the frontier of regulating AI technology and is now moving ahead to regulate generative AI.\n(PAUSE)\nI am now ready to answer your questions.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nThe Commission's intentions towards generative AI.\nAI is now everywhere in our lives. Incredible tool, its use can also lead to the worst consequences. The proliferation of fake news even leads to question the existence of truth. The public space is therefore potentialy in danger and the EU can be one of the actor to help keep its evolution on track.\n \nWhat is generative artificial intelligence (GAI) ?\nGAI is part of artificial intelligence in which computer are able to create content that looks like a content created by a human. This includes text, pictures, music...It is based on a certain amont of collected data that the computer relates to one another just like a human brain.\nThe potential benefits of GAI\nthe benefits are numerous : the most important one is the efficiency of the system. If the computer can create human-like content, it is much more efficient in terms of speed in doing so. Therefore, GAI can be used for logistic organisation for a restaurant for example to help the manager reducing waste. It will reduce organisations' costs, leaders waisted time, waste etc. by supporting organisations to attain their optimal functioning. \nThe dangers of GAI\nif benefits are numerous, dangers are even more numerous and with a potential bigger impact.\nThe human-like component of the GAI leads to forget that algorythms are not able to identify the truth among various false proposals, which represents a major threat to the fight against disinformation, and hence democracy and EU values.\nBiases are reinforced instead of being fought as there is no human ethic approach to avoid them. Statistics are in real life nurturing themselves but it is even more true with algorythms. \"Taking probabilities for certainties means the past will always dictate the future\", this leads deny one's freedom. \nif the data used by the GAI is based on biases, GAI will not know how to mitigate them. This is even more dangerous than people genuinely think that computeur's production, algorythm are neutral and objective. \nThis risks are true for AI in the justice sector, in the health sector, in the information sector, in many major public services.\nIn addition, GAI is a problem for copyrights, data privacy and cybersecurity to a proportion that has the potential to threaten the democracy. \nWhat the EU can do\nThe EU does not want to ban the use of GAI. Chap GPT for example reached 100 million users in only a few weeks. That would not make sense and it is not the direction of history, but regulation is definitely needed in public space.\nThe EU is ralready working at regulating the sector. It has identified four levels or risks, from minimal to unacceptable and proposed to propose a list of high-risk applications, set a clear list of requirements for AI system for these high-risk applications (disclosure of any copyrighted material), define specific obligations for AI users and high-risk applications providers, propose a validation process for AI system before it is placed on the market and an enforcement after its entry on the market as well a governance structure at european and national level.\n \nThe success of GAI, its rapid installation in our daily lives is a turning point in history. Its success calls for a proportional vigilance. Regulation is urgently needed and the EU will be a major actor of it.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}

The drones have proven effective in gathering information quickly and safely, especially in difficult terrain or hard-to-reach areas. The live images captured by the drones can be viewed by police on the ground and have been used to assist firefighters in tackling a large blaze. The drones are seen as a cost-effective tool in fighting crime and helping communities.\n\nHeadline: Drone Makers Focus on Commercial Opportunities\n\nSummary: Drone makers are exploring new commercial opportunities beyond consumer use. Drones are being used for various purposes, such as delivering packages, surveying mines, firefighting, and collecting data for conservation efforts. The industry is adapting to new market dynamics, with industrial and tech groups showing interest in the sector. Regulators are also preparing for change, with the US Federal Aviation Administration opening the skies to commercial drones and providing more certain regulatory guidelines. Drone makers are looking into areas such as agriculture and mosquito elimination to expand their market presence. While consumer drones still dominate the market, the industry is expected to see continued growth in both consumer and commercial sectors.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the Case Study. \n\nBrussels, 16th of June 20XX |  | INTERNAL MEMO |  | From: <your name> | To: Press Office | Subject: U-Space Blueprint |  | Dear colleagues, |  | You are kindly requested to prepare a press release based on the following information. |  | BLUEPRINT FOR DRONE USE IN LOW-LEVEL AIRSPACE UNVEILED TODAY |  | Following a request by the European Commission, the Single European Sky Air traffic management Research Joint Undertaking (SESAR) has today unveiled its blueprint to make drone use in low-level airspace safe, secure and environmentally friendly. |  | The Blueprint is part of the Commission's drive to deliver on its ambitious Aviation Strategy and unleash the full economic potential of drones by 20XX+2. This requires an effective legislative framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of legitimate concerns, the first of which is safety. |  | The blueprint outlines the proposed vision for U-space and how it could be rolled out. Rather than providing a definitive solution, this blueprint provides the basis to better define the way drones will operate in Europe in the future.   |  |  | OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS OF UNMANNED OR REMOTELY PILOTED VEHICLES IN THE EUROPEAN AIRSPACE |  | Drones have been used to shoot weddings, Hollywood movies and terrorists. But now drones are navigating a third path between hobbyists and warfare into the industrial world.  |  | New uses for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging almost daily: delivering packages, pizzas and blood; surveying mines; pre-emptive firefighting; and crime investigations.  |  | According to Gerald Van Hoy, senior research analyst at Gartner, 3 million drones are expected to be shipped this year, and this should translate into revenues of $6 Billion. However, drones pose an array of threats, and reports of drone-related accidents and near-misses are on the rise. Moreover, we can no longer rely on fences or barriers around our homes to protect our privacy and drones without adequate security in place will be vulnerable to hacks, as well as physical attacks.  |  | Theft of data is another real risk, particularly if the drone contains personal or sensitive information, whether this is customer data included for delivery purposes or footage collected via an attached camera.  |  | Accident liability and insurance related legislation is yet to be developed and public acceptance is key to the development of the industry. |  | U-SPACE \u2013 A BLUEPRINT FOR DRONE USE IN LOW-LEVEL AIRSPACE |  | U-space is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for large numbers of drones.  |  | These services rely on a high level of digitalisation and automation of functions, whether they are on board the drone itself or part of the ground-based environment.  |  | U-space provides an enabling framework to support routine drone operations, as well as a clear and effective interface to manned aviation. |  | The delivery of U-space relies upon the following key principles: | To ensure the safety of all airspace users operating in the U-space framework, as well as people on the ground. | To provide a scalable, flexible and adaptable system that can respond to changes in demand, volume, technology, business models and applications, while managing the interface with manned aviation. | To enable high-density operations with multiple automated drones under the supervision of fleet operators. | To guarantee equitable and fair access to airspace for all users. | To enable competitive and cost-effective service provision at all times, supporting the business models of drone operators. | To minimise deployment and operating costs by leveraging as much of the existing aeronautical services and infrastructure as possible, including GNSS as well as those from other sectors, such as mobile communication services. | To accelerate deployment by adopting technologies and standards from other sectors where they meet the needs of U-space. | To follow a risk-based and performance-driven approach when setting up appropriate requirements for safety, security and resilience, while minimising environmental impact and respecting the privacy of citizens, including data protection. |  | Subject to compliance with applicable regulations, operational limitations and technical requirements linked to the operation of the drone, U-space facilitates any kind of mission, from the delivery of goods, aerial work, and search and rescue, to more complex future applications such as urban air mobility. |  | U-space services are offered to both private and public users of drones, for all types of missions.  |  | In addition, the criticality of these services will lead to the establishment of performance requirements for both structural elements and service delivery, covering, for example, safety, security, availability, continuity and resilience. |  | NEXT STEPS |  | The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules that are proportionate to the risk of the operation.  | These rules will implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which the European Parliament and the Council (i.e. the EU Member States) are expected to adopt in the coming months. |  | The Commission, through the SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system. |  | CONCLUSIONS |  | The U-space framework comprises an extensive and scalable range of services relying on agreed EU standards and delivered by service providers.  |  | These services do not look to replicate the function of air traffic control. However, they do deliver key services to organise the safe and efficient operation of drones, ensuring a proper interface with manned aviation, ATC and relevant authorities.  |  |  |  | (signed) | <your name> | DG Mobility and Transport |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nInternal note to the press office\nUpon request of the European Commission (EC), the Single Sky Air traffic management Research Joint Undertaking, whose role is to develop the new generation European air traffic management system, has today unveiled its blueprint to make drone use in low-level airspace safe, secure, and environmentally friendly. This initiative forms part of the EC Aviation Strategy, which is envisaged to be embedded in an effective legislative framework fostering European leadership and competitiveness, while equally addressing some bottlenecks, primarily safety.\nThe Latvian Presidency of the Council of the EU, EC representatives and Directors General of the Civil Aviation of the EU Member States (MS), data protection authorities, leaders of the manufacturing industry and service providers agreed on the importance of Joint Europa Action building on previous experiences drawn from the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems.\nThe EC through SESAR Joint Undertaking will provide funding for a range of drone projects focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system (RPAS)\nBlueprint for drone use in low-level airspace\nIn view of increasing demands for drone services, the blueprint outlines a vision for a U-Space, namely how drones will operate in Europe in the future grounded on the following basic principles:\nSafe: The 150 meters altitude low-level airspace drone will be as good as the one for traditional manned aviation. It will rely on high level of innovative digitalization, guaranteeing equitable  and fair access to the airspace for all users\nAutomated: the system will provide information for highly automated or autonomous drones to fly safely and avoid obstacles or collisions\nStarting to be operational by 20XX+2: for basic services like registration, e-identification and geo-fencing\nOpportunity and threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace\nWhile the usage of drones clearly bring innovative new chances to Europe, it also bears a range of safety and security risks.\nOpportunities: The transformational technology not only offers new services and applications going beyond traditional aviation but also provides for sustainable jobs, innovation, and new prospects for growth both, for the manufacturing industry and for future users of drones in all sectors of society. Existing services will be performed in a more affordable and environmentally friendly way. This will enable a competitive and cost-effective service provisions and facilitate all kinds of missions, such as delivery of goods, aerial work, policing, search and rescue activities as well as contribute to more future oriented urban air mobility projects\nThreats: Malicious use of drones, such as drone jacking, cannot be entirely prevented by design or operational restrictions. Thus, the at times overloaded national police and justice systems need to address those risks. Even if additional budget is foreseen to tackle these shot comings the lack of qualified labor force may still hamper a leverage between risk and risk mitigation measures.\nHacking of the drone itself or its supporting software may result in eighter physical misuse of data breaches, causing interruption of the airspace traffic, personal injury or property damages and theft.\nTransformational technology open for everyone, private or public users, even if certified high risk drones will be subject to licensed remote pilots or operators approved by competent authorities tasked to ensure an appropriate level of safety - the issue here is comparable to the private ownership and use of firearms closely linked to the question: How can the responsible authorities make sure they can handle the amount of malicious drone user cases and effectively fight related cybercrimes?\nCan risks posed on people on the ground and to other aircraft activities as well as threats to privacy, security and data protection violations be sufficiently addressed via the implementation of the legislative framework under development?\nNext steps\nThus, and in line with the EC Aviation Strategy, EU and MS are currently working with industry on effective EU-wide safety regulation to be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in the coming months. The envisaged legislative framework shall also provide guidance for industry, including how to deal with citizens\u2019 concerns.\nAfter a consultation phase involving relevant MS authorities and the European Aviation Safety Agency, the legislative framework including respective provisions in the European Safety Regulation should be announce by the EC, based on the recommendations elaborated, in the course of next year, and be adopted without any delays, taking inter alia the following aspects into account:\nTimely adoption of the legislative framework to offer security to the investors and allow to undertake well-informed decisions (production envisaged as from 20XX-1)\nConserve the safety of the civil aviation in general by and incremental integration of drones into the aviation system in proportion to the operational risk involved, aiming at full integration of drones into the European airspace by 20XX+10\nLarge drones operations must be treated similarly as manned aviation including strict standards on the design manufacturing maintenance and operation of drones as well as dedicated drone pilot training\nEU rules governing the safety and remote pilot and operator qualifications based on experienced gained by respective stakeholder, namely MS authorities and European Aviation Safety Agency\nFull use of existing cooperation mechanisms, such as the Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on unmanned Systems (JARUS) and at ICAO\nSafeguard for protection of privacy and personal data of citizens based on the recommendation and guidance of the national and European Data Protection authorities\nProvisions on the sole responsibility and respective accountability of the use of drones by the operator, including provisions on third party liability and compensation mechanism for damages caused by accidents with drone usages, including a reporting mechanism and obligatory liability insurances.\nEstablish monitoring system for development of drone service and technology managed by Small Medium Enterprise to ensure new drone technologies will be developed in full respect of high level safety, security , data and environmental protection\nDefinition on operational zones as specific zones or open zones with restriction to be designated by MS or delegated private sector players\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 6.0\n\n"}

Commission VP for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton met with representatives of these organizations to discuss the issue. Jourov\u00e1 will present her initiative at a press point, emphasizing the importance of fighting disinformation in the context of defending democracy and EU values.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: The Most Pressing Dangers of AI\n\nSummary: AI systems pose various risks and dangers that need to be addressed. These include techno-solutionism, which views AI as a panacea and can lead to larger problems; the adoption of a statistical perspective on justice, which can result in biased outcomes; the potential for disinformation and threats to democracy through AI manipulation; discrimination and risk in the medical setting; and the risks associated with generative AI, such as deepfakes and the spread of misinformation. The European Commission is proposing a regulatory framework on AI to address these risks and ensure the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses. Additionally, the EU is pushing for AI labels to identify AI-generated content and fight against deepfakes and disinformation.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \nPress point by Commission VP Jourova on generative AI\n10th of June 20XX at 11:15 \u2013 Charlemagne building (Room TBD) \n(INTRODUCTION)\nGood morning.\nWe are living in a Brave New World.\nGenerative AI is making breathtaking advances \u2014 from writing texts to creating ever more realistic pictures and videos.\nOver these last months we have been baffled by the exploits of ChatGTP and DALL.E, to the point that many of us in this room are fearing for their job in a not-so-distant future.\nBut there is more: generative AI will have enormous consequences not just for the future of our work, but for society, politics, and democracy. \nYesterday, Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton and myself have met representatives of 40-odd companies and organizations that have signed up to the EU\u2019s Code of Practice against disinformation. \nWe have asked them to come up with a clear labelling system to identify AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation. \nThe Commission wants to prevent artificial intelligence from blurring the lines between fact and fiction.\nToday, I would like to put this initiative in its wider context for you.\n(PAUSE)\n(WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI)\nNow, what exactly is generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\nGenerative AI generates outputs that appear authentic and human-like: text, images, graphics, music, etc.\nGenerative AI algorithms learn from training data that include examples of the desired output. \nBased on the patterns and structures within the training data, generative AI models can produce new content that shares characteristics with the original input data. \nThe most compelling advantage generative AI proposes is that it enables businesses to automate specific tasks and focus time, energy, and resources on more important strategic objectives:\nFor example, in content creation, generative AI can produce text, images and even music, assisting marketers, journalists, and artists with their creative processes. \nIn customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can provide more personalized assistance and reduce response times.\nGenerative AI is used in medicine to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs, saving time and money in research. \n\n(PAUSE)\n\n(THE DANGERS OF GENERATIVE AI)\nHowever, generative AI presents numerous issues requiring attention. \nOne major concern is its potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThe technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage. \nDisinformation poses serious threats to society, as it effectively changes and manipulates evidence to create social feedback loops that undermine any sense of objective truth. \nAI systems used to spread disinformation on the internet, can become a threat to society, politics, and democracy. \n(PAUSE)\n\n(LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON AI)\nSome two years ago, the European Commission began drafting the first-ever legal framework on AI, addressing the risks of AI and positioning Europe to play a leading role globally. \nA couple of weeks ago, this new Legal Framework on AI entered the co-decision stage. \nUnder the proposals, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level: from minimal through to limited, high, and unacceptable. \nWhile high-risk tools will not be banned, those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations.\nClearly, many generative AI systems belong in the high-risk category.\n(PAUSE)\n(NEW RULES FOR GENERATIVE AI)\nLast April, the European Union proposed new copyright rules for generative AI.\nCompanies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney, will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems.\nSome committee members initially proposed banning copyrighted material being used to train generative AI models altogether, but this was abandoned in favour of a transparency requirement.\nClear Labels. Services with a potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation should put in place technology to recognize such content and clearly label this to users. \nThe label should apply to all AI-generated material that can be used to create disinformation, including text, images, audio, and video.\nOn the other hand, services that integrate generative AI like Bingchat for Microsoft, Bard for Google should build in necessary safeguards that these services cannot be used by malicious actors to generate disinformation.\nFor now, labelling wouldn\u2019t be mandatory, given that it would be part of the voluntary Code of Practice. \nHowever, the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act (DSA). \nObligations on labeling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament, and the Commission.\n(CONCLUSION)\nAllow me to conclude this brief presentation now.\nGenerative AI has the potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThis poses a threat to our democratic society.\nThe EU is on the frontier of regulating AI technology and is now moving ahead to regulate generative AI.\n(PAUSE)\nI am now ready to answer your questions.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nSPEAKING NOTE ON GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (GAI)\nGAI AND ITS POTENTIAL BENEFITS\nWhat is GAI?\nGAI is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in which algorithms are used to create content that seems human created such as text, graphs or music.\nGAI algorithms are designed to learn from the data they receive, like this they can systematically improve the quality of their outputs. The more data they receive the better outputs they produce. \nPotential Benefits of GAI\nCompanies will have the opportunity to use GAI to carry out simple and repetitive tasks, allowing their staff to focus on more strategic and creative tasks.\nAnother potential benefit of GAI would be an improvement in the quality of certain social services such as healthcare or education. Through GAI, healthacre would see the research on new drugs significantly improved and Education could benefit from improved training materials.\nDANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH  GAI AND HOW TO ADDRESS THEM\nDespite the potential benefits mentioned above, GAI poses serious dangers that should be closely monitored: \n- The capacity of GAI to generate images that seem real, known as deepfakes, poses a serious danger since they could be easily used to spread misinformation. The widespread of deepfakes through social media could, for example, have an impact in electoral processes, posing a threat to social stability and democracy.\n- Rely on GAI without human surveillance is also a risk, since GAI could create content that is biased and discriminatory to sexual and racial minorities. \nHOW TO ADDRESS THESE DANGERS\nFirst of all, there is a need for transparency in GAI in order to ensure that its algorithms produce contents that are socially acceptable and inclusive.\nSecondly, there is risk that GAI uses materials that are protected by copyright to generate content. For this reason, the EU is already preparing a legislation to ensure that GAI discloses any copyright material used.\nLastly, there is a need to raise awareness among population about GAI, its benefits but also the threats that it implies. A population who is aware of the dangers of GAI, and has the capacity to easily identify it would be a shield against its malicious use.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}

Commission VP for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton met with representatives of these organizations to discuss the issue. Jourov\u00e1 will present her initiative at a press point, emphasizing the importance of fighting disinformation in the context of defending democracy and EU values.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: The Most Pressing Dangers of AI\n\nSummary: AI systems pose various risks and dangers that need to be addressed. These include techno-solutionism, which views AI as a panacea and can lead to larger problems; the adoption of a statistical perspective on justice, which can result in biased outcomes; the potential for disinformation and threats to democracy through AI manipulation; discrimination and risk in the medical setting; and the risks associated with generative AI, such as deepfakes and the spread of misinformation. The European Commission is proposing a regulatory framework on AI to address these risks and ensure the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses. Additionally, the EU is pushing for AI labels to identify AI-generated content and fight against deepfakes and disinformation.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \nPress point by Commission VP Jourova on generative AI\n10th of June 20XX at 11:15 \u2013 Charlemagne building (Room TBD) \n(INTRODUCTION)\nGood morning.\nWe are living in a Brave New World.\nGenerative AI is making breathtaking advances \u2014 from writing texts to creating ever more realistic pictures and videos.\nOver these last months we have been baffled by the exploits of ChatGTP and DALL.E, to the point that many of us in this room are fearing for their job in a not-so-distant future.\nBut there is more: generative AI will have enormous consequences not just for the future of our work, but for society, politics, and democracy. \nYesterday, Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton and myself have met representatives of 40-odd companies and organizations that have signed up to the EU\u2019s Code of Practice against disinformation. \nWe have asked them to come up with a clear labelling system to identify AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation. \nThe Commission wants to prevent artificial intelligence from blurring the lines between fact and fiction.\nToday, I would like to put this initiative in its wider context for you.\n(PAUSE)\n(WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI)\nNow, what exactly is generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\nGenerative AI generates outputs that appear authentic and human-like: text, images, graphics, music, etc.\nGenerative AI algorithms learn from training data that include examples of the desired output. \nBased on the patterns and structures within the training data, generative AI models can produce new content that shares characteristics with the original input data. \nThe most compelling advantage generative AI proposes is that it enables businesses to automate specific tasks and focus time, energy, and resources on more important strategic objectives:\nFor example, in content creation, generative AI can produce text, images and even music, assisting marketers, journalists, and artists with their creative processes. \nIn customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can provide more personalized assistance and reduce response times.\nGenerative AI is used in medicine to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs, saving time and money in research. \n\n(PAUSE)\n\n(THE DANGERS OF GENERATIVE AI)\nHowever, generative AI presents numerous issues requiring attention. \nOne major concern is its potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThe technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage. \nDisinformation poses serious threats to society, as it effectively changes and manipulates evidence to create social feedback loops that undermine any sense of objective truth. \nAI systems used to spread disinformation on the internet, can become a threat to society, politics, and democracy. \n(PAUSE)\n\n(LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON AI)\nSome two years ago, the European Commission began drafting the first-ever legal framework on AI, addressing the risks of AI and positioning Europe to play a leading role globally. \nA couple of weeks ago, this new Legal Framework on AI entered the co-decision stage. \nUnder the proposals, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level: from minimal through to limited, high, and unacceptable. \nWhile high-risk tools will not be banned, those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations.\nClearly, many generative AI systems belong in the high-risk category.\n(PAUSE)\n(NEW RULES FOR GENERATIVE AI)\nLast April, the European Union proposed new copyright rules for generative AI.\nCompanies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney, will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems.\nSome committee members initially proposed banning copyrighted material being used to train generative AI models altogether, but this was abandoned in favour of a transparency requirement.\nClear Labels. Services with a potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation should put in place technology to recognize such content and clearly label this to users. \nThe label should apply to all AI-generated material that can be used to create disinformation, including text, images, audio, and video.\nOn the other hand, services that integrate generative AI like Bingchat for Microsoft, Bard for Google should build in necessary safeguards that these services cannot be used by malicious actors to generate disinformation.\nFor now, labelling wouldn\u2019t be mandatory, given that it would be part of the voluntary Code of Practice. \nHowever, the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act (DSA). \nObligations on labeling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament, and the Commission.\n(CONCLUSION)\nAllow me to conclude this brief presentation now.\nGenerative AI has the potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThis poses a threat to our democratic society.\nThe EU is on the frontier of regulating AI technology and is now moving ahead to regulate generative AI.\n(PAUSE)\nI am now ready to answer your questions.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nWHAT IS GAI\nGenerative AI is a sub field of articial intelligence, where computer algoritms are used to create output that seems to be created by human being. Some example of results can be, text, image, video and coding line.\nThese algoritms are fed with training data, which includes some example of desired output. Algoritms analyse the structure of those training data and can create new outputs, which can seem unique and made by human.\nGAI is a machine learning process, it continues to fine tunes itself, the more contents are created the more sophisticated and convincing outcome will become.\n \nGAI POTENTIAL BENEFITS\nGenerative Artificial intelligence has several benefit, infact it can be used to improve efficiencies within business environment but also in private life. GAI can carry out specific and easy task and give more time to focus on more strategic and important activities.\nIn business environment it is mainly used as previously said to improve efficiencies, this means lower labour cost. It is used in several field, such as:\n-Healthcare to enhance discoveries and elaborate data,\n-Finance to study and predict stock market trends,\n-Education to produce training material and assessment that fit better to students,\n-Marketing to create new content which are dedicated to specific customers,\n-Environment to predict weather analysing data.\n-in several field can be help in customer support, with virtual assistent and in general to analyse data and improving deicsion making process.\nBenefits are visible and even if it is a relatively new discover, lot of companies and people are relying on it.\n \nWHAT ARE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH GAI\nUnfortunately since it a relatively new discovery, GAI needs still to be discover fully and the related dangers with it. \nDangers can be the spread of misinformation, malicious or sensitive contents, which can bring damage to people and business, some of them can be:\n-Hallucination, sometimes GAI can produce wrong output and it can be a problem for people that are relying too much on it, we need to remember that it is still a machine and does not have the same understanding of human being.\n-Deepfakes, as explained before GAI can be used to produce fake news or fake content such as video or picture, which can harm people or businesses. i particular this can harm EU value of democracy be used to manupulate information and influence people in politics but also in their opinion.\n-Dataprivacy, GAI can be used to solve problem, for example in our business but all the information, also sensitive ones, that we give to this system are stored and can be used in different ways,\n-Cybersecurity, related to previous point some of the information given can be use to harm business or people.\n-Copyright, GAI is fed with training data, but it can include data from different source and authors, for this reason the output result can be a mix of all those information and the output can be a violation of copyright.\n-Wokforce, finally another fundamental point is that increasing efficiencies will usually lead to reduce the workforce to improve company copetitiveness. in this way workers can lose their job and they will be in the position of rebuild themself and upskill in order to compete with AI or find alternatives jobs.\nHOW EU WANTS TO ADDRESS GAI DANGERS?\nBased on previous brief list of danges, it is needed to find a way to regulate GAI to use this powerful tool in the safetiest possible way.\nEU is proposiing the first ever legal framework on AI, in the AI package it is also include the Coordinated plan on AI. These two measures will guarantee safety and fundamental right for people and business and will reduce the cost and investment to access this technology especially for SMEs.\nThis proposal will set clear requirements and obligations regarding specific use of AI.\nIn April 20XX European Union proposed a new Copyright rules for generative EU, which would require companies to disclose any compyright material used to develop those tools. The aim to use these rules to improve transparency and ethics, and minimizing misues and infringment of copyrights.\nFurthermore, based on regulatory framewoek all tool will be classified based on associated risk which can be, Unacceptable risk, High risk, Limited risk and Minimal risk.\nPart oEuropean Union wants also to address directly the problem of segregation of fact and fiction, for this reason, EU wants to ask company to label all contents that are created by GAI.\nThe proposal is to labe all AI materials created to tackle the proble of misinformation about text, images, video or audio. For now this labelling it is not mandatory but discussion is ongoing among EU countries, Parliament and commission.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 5.0\n\n"}

The legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of batteries, from raw material supply chain to production, reuse, and recycling. The proposal aligns with the European Green Deal, Circular Economy Action Plan, and New Industrial Strategy. The Council and European Parliament have reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. An internal reflection and brainstorming meeting is planned to fine-tune the original proposal in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to build a resilient lithium supply chain\n\nSummary: Europe is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for lithium, a key metal used in batteries for electric vehicles. The European Union (EU) plans to release its Critical Raw Materials Act, which will identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk. The EU aims to become climate neutral by 2050 and has set ambitious goals for the electrification of transportation. However, challenges faced by carmakers and concerns about supply availability and access to raw materials continue to impact the growth of the electric vehicle market in Europe.\n\nHeadline: European Commission considers classifying lithium as toxic\n\nSummary: The European Commission is considering a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If approved, this classification could undermine the EU's efforts to create a domestic battery materials supply chain. The EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium for its electric vehicle production sector, and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions. The proposal could have an impact on lithium mining, processing, cathode production, and recycling.\n\nHeadline: The Inflation Reduction Act stimulates battery mineral mining in the US\n\nSummary: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US is expected to stimulate a \"gold rush\" in battery mineral mining, refining, and production. The IRA offers tax credits for various stages of battery production and the battery supply chain, making it more appealing for companies to bring full-cycle battery production to the US. This includes mining and refining battery minerals, producing battery cells, and battery pack production. The IRA aims to reduce the US's dependence on China for battery minerals and increase domestic production.\n\nHeadline: Russia plans to start lithium mining in the next few years\n\nSummary: Russia is planning to start lithium mining based on ore deposits in the Murmansk region within the next three to four years. The country has significant lithium reserves, accounting for 10% of the world's reserves. The demand for lithium is expected to increase in the next decade, and Russia aims to become one of the world's top five producers of lithium. The next stage of Russia's lithium industry development will be the application of technologies for lithium production from solutions found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields.\n\nHeadline: Meeting the growing demand for lithium in the electric vehicle industry\n\nSummary: The demand for lithium is expected to rise significantly due to the growing electric vehicle industry. Despite the expected increase in demand, the lithium industry is expected to provide enough supply to meet the needs of the lithium-ion battery industry. In addition to increasing conventional lithium supply, new technologies such as direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP) offer promise in increasing supply, reducing the industry's environmental impact, and lowering costs. Battery recycling is also expected to increase, providing a secondary supply of lithium.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the Case Study. \nMemo | Regulation on batteries and waste batteries | In December 20XX-2, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on batteries and waste batteries. The proposal aims to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery life cycle. The initiative is closely linked to the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the New Industrial Strategy.  | At the end of last year, The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. For the first time the legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of a battery \u2013 from the supply chain of raw materials, over the production to reuse and recycling of batteries \u2013 and ensure that they are safe, sustainable, and competitive. | The purpose of this memo is to launch the interservice consultation procedure for the new Regulation on Batteries and waste batteries. It is intended to structure the review of the original proposal, considering the observations of the Council and the European Parliament, and to further materialize the specific requirements by setting measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based targets and objectives. |  | Context | The European Union (EU) has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Recently proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035. | As sales of electric vehicles increase, carmakers are looking to secure supply of key metals used in batteries, including lithium. Today, Europe is quite dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply and China for lithium refining. While only around 9% of the world's lithium is mined in China, around 60% is refined there. | With expected battery lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles, and the possibility of extending EV battery life through use in the energy-storage sector, battery recycling is expected to increase during the current decade, but not to game-changing levels. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. By 2030, such secondary supply is expected to account for slightly more than 6 percent of total lithium production. | Although Europe is pushing to build a resilient supply chain by partnering with allies and developing domestic resources, it might not all be good news for miners in the region \u2014 at the end of last year, the European Commission said it will weigh a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, recycling, and handling of the materials.  |  | Agenda | General  | The new regulation should apply to all batteries including all waste portable batteries, electric vehicle batteries, industrial batteries, starting, lightning and ignition batteries, and batteries for light means of transport (e.g., electric bikes, e-mopeds, e-scooters). | Supply chain of raw materials | EU needs to boost its local mining and refining capacity and shift more towards trustworthy suppliers.  | Target for local mining: cover the EU needs for XX% by 20XX+Y.  | Due diligence of raw materials\u2019 origin, carbon intensity requirements and more efficient use of raw materials. Target date: end of 20XX+Y. Possible exemption for SMEs from the due diligence rules (to be discussed). | Refinery: More recycled content in new batteries second life for industrial batteries. Targets for producers to collect waste portable batteries (XX% by the end of 20XX+Y). Introduction of dedicated collection objective for waste batteries for light means of transport (YY% by the end of 20XX+Y). | Market: Promote a circular battery industry, market for secondary raw materials, clearer labelling, and information with \u201cbattery passports\u201d and QR codes | End of use: Strict collection schemes and recycling targets, better ways of re-using old batteries, battery traceability, more efficient recycling of waste batteries, ensure the environmentally sound treatment of waste batteries, incentives for further recycling. | Production of batteries in the EU | 20XX+1: additional investment of \u20acXX billion in R&D for European battery production and electric cars. | Targets: by 20XX+Y Local producers cover the EU's demand and by 20XX+Y, EU produces next generation battery and EV technologies.  | By 20XX+Y, the EU sets a global sustainable standard in the global market. | Functioning of the internal market  | The new rules aim to improve the functioning of the internal market for batteries and ensure fairer competition. This will be reached through performance, durability and safety criteria, tight restrictions for hazardous substances like mercury, cadmium and lead and mandatory information on the carbon footprint of batteries. The regulation also introduces labelling and information requirements, among other things on the battery's components and recycled content, and an electronic \u201cbattery passport\u201d and a QR code. | Setting of a realistic implementation schedule.\u00a0Notably, labelling requirements will apply after XX months after entry into force of the Regulation and after XX months for the QR code. |  |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n1 March 20XX, ME, Unit...\nInternal MEMO\nRegulation on Batteries and Waste Batteries\n \nThe purpose of the present MEMO is to outline the current state of play on the Batteries Regulation file, and to propose an Agenda with points for discussion and proposed way forward for the internal meeting.\n1. Current state of play\n- At the end of 20XX-1, the proposal from the Commission has reached a political agreement in the Council and the European Parliament.-\n- The EU is aiming to become climate neutral by 2050, a policy that related legislative proposals need to take into account.\n- Regarding specifically lithium batteries, at the moment China is the biggest actor in processing and supplying lithium, with the United States (USA) implementing internal measures to challenge the monopoly (such as tax benefits for lithium processing) and with Russia planning to launch their own production soon. The European Union (EU) is dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply.\nEven if 90% of lithium is used for batteries and its use is therefore essential for expanding the electric vehicles fleet, health concerns are rising and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) will declare it dangerous for human health. At the same time, prices of lithium have increased drastically. Last but important, lithium has a very low recycling rate, only 6% of lithium production coming from recycling. \n- The EU's interest is to ensure independence, as much as possible, from external sources. The EU will soon adopt the Critical Raw Materials Act, aiming at building up reserves of raw materials at local EU level.\nHaving regard to the above, the following Agenda and way forward is proposed:\n2. Agenda and way forward\na) Updated statistics on batteries - materials extraction, production and recycling, including global trends (updated information from beginning of 20XX to be obtained)\nb) Strategy for the gradual phase-out of lithium batteries (since phase-out cannot happen quickly)\n- short-term (by end of 20XX+2) : introduce incentives (tax benefits and pricing control over raw materials) to ensure 20% independence regarding lithium for batteries, in coordination with the Critical Raw Materials Act.\n- mid-term (by end of 20XX+5) : in parallel, invest in projects for the research and development of other types of batteries (such as hydrogen, solar) and aim to increase by 20% the diversification of batteries from other renewable and recyclable sources by the end of this period.\n- long-term (by end of 20XX+10): aim to obtain 80% of batteries from renewable sources.\nc) waste batteries - introduce short-term (20XX+2), meduim (20XX+5) and long-term (20XX+10) goals for recycled batteries, respectively 20%, 50% and 80%.\n3. Conclusion\nThe goal of the Regulation should be to ensure, as much as possible, independence of the EU from the other global actors on the energy scene, while respecting the health of EU citizens and contributing to the climate neutral goals of the EU.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}

She assured that industry interests will not dominate the decision-making process and that the strong message from European citizens regarding animal rights and welfare will be respected.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \n\nIntroduction and background\nThis briefing note summarises the main remaining issues in the preparation of our draft proposal for the revised animal welfare regulation. Following the impact assessment concluded last year, a legislative proposal has been prepared and the inter-service consultation was recently concluded. We received positive opinions except for one negative opinion from DG AGRI, setting a condition regarding the preferred option for banning cages for laying hens.\n\nMain issues\nThe legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: \nrestricting the use of cages/crates;\nending the killing of day-old male chickens;\nbanning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and\nsetting animal welfare requirements at import.\n\nThe legislative proposal is based on the medium or high ambition option for all these measures. The cost-benefit analysis from the impact assessment showed that this would be the most efficient way forward. It is also in line with the outcomes of our stakeholder consultations and pressure from citizens. \n\nOther DGs support our draft proposal except when it comes to the ban on cages for laying hens. DG AGRI are concerned about the risk of unfair competition and raised food prices as a result of a cage ban. They therefore issued a negative opinion in the inter-service consultation. DG AGRI wants to see the low-ambition option (phase-in of a cage ban over 12 years) or even no legislative change at all, whereas the DG SANTE preferred option is the high-ambition option with phase-in over 5 years and no exceptions made. We would also like to see the ban combined with space requirements to ensure that free-range hens have sufficient living area. Sufficient space per animal is also needed for health and safety reasons including to minimise the risk of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nIt is true that this high-ambition option would have an impact on food pricing, though our impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. The main limitation is that poultry farmers will be able to house fewer birds per square meter. To some extent, farmers could be compensated for this via the Common Agricultural Policy or other economic incentives.\n\nFor small farmers, this seems not to be a main issue, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. In several Member States, the cage ban will also make no difference as they already adopted a ban within their national legislation. For internal market purposes, a cage ban would therefore help create a more level playing field.\n\nA more important problem is the competition with imported goods from third countries. This seems to be the real core concern of DG AGRI. Among our proposed options, we did propose to require stricter animal welfare rules also for imported animals and animal products, though our impact assessment implied that the medium ambition option would be the most cost-efficient choice.\n\nOptions for the way forward\nThere seems to be two main options for the way forward: compromise on the cage ban or compromise on the import rules.\n\nA compromise on the cage ban for laying hens would mean abandonning our preferred option to settle at the low or medium options instead. This would still be an improvement compared to the current situation. However, it is likely that the Commission would then be heavily criticised by NGOs as well as by the European Parliament who called for a total ban in shorter time. \n\nThe other possibility would be to focus instead on the real underlying problem raised by DG AGRI: the risk of unfair competition from third countries. DG AGRI have indicated that the transition time and exceptions for small farms are not the real problem, so a compromise solution on the cage ban proposal is not necessarily in their best interest. We could instead try to convince them to change their current position and accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages, in exchange for instead increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).\n\nThis would however require another round of talks also with DG TRADE who gave a positive opinion in the inter-service consultation. We have no information about their willingness to agree to such a compromise.\n\nConclusion\nOur recommendation is to, as a first priority, seek a compromise with DG AGRI based on stricter import rules. This would address their main concern while not compromising our preferred options or lowering the level of ambition for animal welfare.\n\nIf this fails, the fallback option could be to strike a compromise based on a longer phase-in period of the cage ban (low or medium ambition option).\n\nIf you agree to this plan of action, we can start informally consulting DG AGRI and DG TRADE immediately\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nElements to highlight from the impact assessment report produced by the Commission on 13.10 202X-1 on the draft revised regulation on animal welfare\nTimeline: Range is between +5 and +12. 202X+10 is considered a medium ambition timeline;\nPositive impact in relation to:\n- air and water pollution,\n-animal health,\n-advancement on EU animal welfare legislation considering more recent advancement in zootechnics and agricultural practices;\n- mitigation on the current negative impact on single market because of the too fragmented situation among member states;\n-Massive support among public opinion \n- Experience in Germany and the Netherlands show a limited impact on prices for consumers\nNegative impact in relation to increase costs and possible challenges from extra EU actors but mitigating actions can be adopted as awareness raising campaigns, subisidies to specific sectors, adaptation of the implementation timeline, introduction of temporary exceptions, EU standards to be imposed to extra EU products.\nTo complement the impact assessment, EFSA highlights that scientific studies have shown the importance of stressing on ensuring high quality standards/controls and a correct implementation of non-caged farming in order to avoid other issues to surge (ie higher prevalence of microbial resistance). EFSA recommends to take this into consideration during the drafting revised regulation.\nPosition of EU Parliament\n- On 20.2. 202X-2, the EP had voted in favour to a resolution for the end caged farmings (558 in favour, 37 against and 85 abstentions) by 202x-1\nPosition of DG AGRI\n- concerns about poultry cage rearing, more specifically:\n1. threshold needs to reviewed considering that, as currently defined, it has a limited impact/relevance based on the characteristics of the EU market;\n2. Impact on the cost-efficiency for the production;\n3. Risk of unfair competition from the actors outside the EU\n4. Increase of prices of eggs (20-40%) and impact on poorest consumers;\nIn order to avoid the blocking of the proposal from DG AGRI, we do recommend to establish a dialogue with DG AGRI and evaluate together if, based on some of the below elements, a compromise could be found.\nThe suggested points below take into consideration the main concerns expressed by DG AGRI (Michael Robinson) to DGSANTE (Wiebke Munoz) on 16.05.202X and referred above in the state of play section of this document. They are all in line with previous committments/public statements done by the Commission, and with the impact assessment\n- Increase transition time (while EP proposes 202x+1, the impact assessment considers a timeframe between 5 and 12 years);\n- Consider subsidies to support with the transition (ie for countries whose current level of cage-free production are beyond X%, ie Spain, Portugal and Malta have the lowest levels of cage free production) and mitigate the impact of prices;\n- Ensuring that higher EU standards that will be binding for anybody who wants to enter the EU market (in order to avoid unfair competition from outside EU);\n- Refer to the impact assessment\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 4.0\n\n"}

But now drones are navigating a third path between hobbyists and warfare into the industrial world.  |  | New uses for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging almost daily: delivering packages, pizzas and blood; surveying mines; pre-emptive firefighting; and crime investigations.  |  | According to Gerald Van Hoy, senior research analyst at Gartner, 3 million drones are expected to be shipped this year, and this should translate into revenues of $6 Billion. However, drones pose an array of threats, and reports of drone-related accidents and near-misses are on the rise. Moreover, we can no longer rely on fences or barriers around our homes to protect our privacy and drones without adequate security in place will be vulnerable to hacks, as well as physical attacks.  |  | Theft of data is another real risk, particularly if the drone contains personal or sensitive information, whether this is customer data included for delivery purposes or footage collected via an attached camera.  |  | Accident liability and insurance related legislation is yet to be developed and public acceptance is key to the development of the industry. |  | U-SPACE \u2013 A BLUEPRINT FOR DRONE USE IN LOW-LEVEL AIRSPACE |  | U-space is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for large numbers of drones.  |  | These services rely on a high level of digitalisation and automation of functions, whether they are on board the drone itself or part of the ground-based environment.  |  | U-space provides an enabling framework to support routine drone operations, as well as a clear and effective interface to manned aviation. |  | The delivery of U-space relies upon the following key principles: | To ensure the safety of all airspace users operating in the U-space framework, as well as people on the ground. | To provide a scalable, flexible and adaptable system that can respond to changes in demand, volume, technology, business models and applications, while managing the interface with manned aviation. | To enable high-density operations with multiple automated drones under the supervision of fleet operators. | To guarantee equitable and fair access to airspace for all users. | To enable competitive and cost-effective service provision at all times, supporting the business models of drone operators. | To minimise deployment and operating costs by leveraging as much of the existing aeronautical services and infrastructure as possible, including GNSS as well as those from other sectors, such as mobile communication services. | To accelerate deployment by adopting technologies and standards from other sectors where they meet the needs of U-space. | To follow a risk-based and performance-driven approach when setting up appropriate requirements for safety, security and resilience, while minimising environmental impact and respecting the privacy of citizens, including data protection. |  | Subject to compliance with applicable regulations, operational limitations and technical requirements linked to the operation of the drone, U-space facilitates any kind of mission, from the delivery of goods, aerial work, and search and rescue, to more complex future applications such as urban air mobility. |  | U-space services are offered to both private and public users of drones, for all types of missions.  |  | In addition, the criticality of these services will lead to the establishment of performance requirements for both structural elements and service delivery, covering, for example, safety, security, availability, continuity and resilience. |  | NEXT STEPS |  | The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules that are proportionate to the risk of the operation.  | These rules will implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which the European Parliament and the Council (i.e. the EU Member States) are expected to adopt in the coming months. |  | The Commission, through the SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system. |  | CONCLUSIONS |  | The U-space framework comprises an extensive and scalable range of services relying on agreed EU standards and delivered by service providers.  |  | These services do not look to replicate the function of air traffic control. However, they do deliver key services to organise the safe and efficient operation of drones, ensuring a proper interface with manned aviation, ATC and relevant authorities.  |  |  |  | (signed) | <your name> | DG Mobility and Transport |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nDear Press Service Colleagues,\nPlease find below the draft press release for the U-Space blueprint publication for your perusal. Just to recall our first meeting, we have agreed to draft the press release together and advance the preparations of the launch. \nA couple of points to follow up our discussion and to consider while you look at this draft:\n- The timeline on the making the blueprint a reality may seem ambitious to readers and the media. This is why I took the liberty of  drafting some defensive points that might help you answer the questions. Note: my suggestions for the defensives reflect more issues, not only the timeline. Also, the answers are not yet drafted, and we should discuss these.\n- Secondly, as the EU's Basic Aviation Safety legislation is still not adopted yet, we should prepare for question on how we intend to address any potential efforts to water down our proposal. The body of research and evidence prepared about the benefits of 'unmanned areal vehicles' aka drones is huge and diverse. We should discuss which domain (agriculture, healthcare, delivery service) to focus on. \n- Thirdly and perhaps most importantly, we must be ready to defend our decision against disinformation about drones. There is a lot of negative media about near-misses at airports and some people argue that the EU wants to bring in even more drones. These are isolated incidents, but in case the news break, they can go very viral. As discussed earlier, we will need to focus on the immense economic benefits, new market opportunities and completely new entrepreneurship paths that this will bring. Mentioning the jobs these opportunities will generate is also worth it. \nI look forward to hearing the results of the media sweep you conducted and to hear the suggestions how you intend to counter disinformation about drone use. \nWe can be proud to be part of process of bringing these technologies faster to the market. Recalling my presentation to you about the potential benefits of drones form the first meeting when we agreed to jointly develop this press release: there are incredible benefits in surveillance of agricultural, inspection of fires, delivery of life-saving medicine to remote areas and the list of interesting applications goes on and on.    \nAs next steps, I suggest we discuss the press release based on the below draft, the full choreography of the blueprint's launch and next steps in a call at your convenience. Feel free to send me comments, suggestions, ideas about the press release in the meantime, I will be glad to integrate them and circulate a new version of the press release before we speak. \nAfter our discussion, we will schedule another meeting with colleagues from the SESAR Joint Undertaking to ensure the press release reflects their expertise. \nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need more information,\nKind regards,\nErik\n=================\nPress release draft\nFor immediate release\nBringing the skies of the future closer to citizen today: The EU is making \nToday, [Date] the European Commission through is  is presenting a blueprint for a future framework under which drones will be able to operate safely and drone services grow to the benefit of all Europeans.\nOur ambition is to provide a safe and flexible environment in which drones can improve the lives of citizens and allow Member States to jointly harness the enormous economic potential of drones. \nThe Commission presents, U-space, a set of rules that will ensure reliable, safe and efficient procedures will guide the commercial as well as personal use drones. The blueprint will ensure that an ever increasing number of drones in the airspace will remain of no hazard to other users.\nThe Commission intends to finance the further development of drone projects to ensure that the various services and market players are well integrated and \nU-space will provide an enabling framework to support routine drone operations, as well as a clear rules for traditional users of the airspace, for instance civilian aviation. \nThe main principles: \n[I suggest focusing on maximum three, for instance: safety, scalability and fair access to airspace]; let's discuss in the call.\n[closing part:]\nDrones have enormous potential and their application is impressively wide. \n=================\nDefensives:\n[Answers to be discussed and brainstormed in our meeting]\nHow do you intend to control the number of drones in the sky?\nWhy do we need EU level rules for drones? \nHow do you intend to address the concerns voiced in the European Parliament about the interference of drones at airports? \nWhy does the EU only react now, when there are already so many accidents reported involving drones?\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 5.0\n\n"}

The Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) has prepared a draft legislative proposal based on an impact assessment and stakeholder consultations. An inter-service consultation with other Directorates-General (DGs) has recently been concluded. The Director-General of DG SANTE now needs to decide on the next steps to reach a compromise text for approval by the college of Commissioners. The briefing note for the Director-General should include a summary of the main issues and remaining problems, as well as arguments and facts to assist in making a decision on the file.\n\nAbbreviations (if any): \n\n\nEmail Instructions to be followed: \nHeadline: Animal Welfare Legislative Proposal Briefing\n\nSummary: This briefing is for the Director-General, Ms Heinrich, regarding the state of play concerning the draft revised animal welfare regulation. The draft legislative proposal follows the preferred options identified in the impact assessment and aims to serve the policy objectives of DG SANTE. However, DG AGRI has not accepted the proposal, requiring either compromise adjustments or convincing DG AGRI to accept the main line. The briefing will outline the main issues and present options for the next steps, allowing the Director-General to make an informed decision. The briefing should be kept short and concise, no more than two pages.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: DG AGRI has a negative opinion on the proposed revised regulation on animal welfare\n\nSummary: DG AGRI has provided a negative opinion on the proposed revised regulation on animal welfare, specifically regarding the use of cages for laying hens. They argue that the proposed exception for smaller farms does not make sense and that the new rules would lead to higher food prices and unfair competition with imported products. They suggest that either the low ambition option or the status quo should apply for the protection of the single market and competitive pricing of European high standard food products.\n\nHeadline: DG ENV supports the proposed revised regulation on animal welfare\n\nSummary: DG ENV has provided a positive opinion on the proposed revised regulation on animal welfare. They state that the proposal is important and in line with the European Green Deal objectives. They support the general approach and preferred options of the proposal. They have provided minor editorial comments for consideration.\n\nHeadline: DG TRADE has a positive opinion on the proposed revised regulation on animal welfare\n\nSummary: DG TRADE has provided a positive opinion on the proposed revised regulation on animal welfare.

The initiative aims to phase out and prohibit the use of animal cages in the European Union. The initiative has gathered 1.4 million signatures, making it one of the most strongly supported citizens' initiatives. The European Commission has committed to proposing legislation to address this issue by the end of the year.\n\nHeadline: MEPs endorse EU citizens' call for gradual end to caged farming\n\nSummary: The European Parliament has voted in favor of a resolution recommending a total ban on the use of cages in animal agriculture within the next 5 years. The resolution follows the \"End the Cage Age\" European citizens' initiative, which gathered 1.4 million signatures. The resolution received strong support from MEPs, with 558 votes in favor, 37 against, and 85 abstentions. The resolution calls for a phased-out approach to ending caged farming and emphasizes the need for compliance with EU standards for imported products.\n\nHeadline: Concerns raised about antimicrobial resistance in non-cage housing systems for poultry\n\nSummary: The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) has raised concerns about the higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in non-cage housing systems for poultry. They emphasize the need for strict quality standards and proper implementation to prevent the emergence of resistant bacteria. They suggest that livestock density needs to be reduced to ensure safe food production and avoid antibiotics resistance.\n\nHeadline: Impact assessment report on revised animal welfare regulation\n\nSummary: The impact assessment report on the revised animal welfare regulation has been released. The report assesses the impacts of various policy measures, including the phasing out of confining cages for pigs, calves, laying hens, rabbits, and fur-producing animals, the banning of the killing of day-old male chicks, the banning of painful mutilations, and animal welfare requirements at import. The report considers cost-efficiency, environmental and societal impacts, and impacts on the single market. It also highlights the need for a balanced and economically viable transition to cage-free farming and suggests measures such as economic incentives and awareness campaigns.\n\nHeadline: Commissioner Kyriakides meets with \"End the Cage Age\" representatives\n\nSummary: Commissioner Stella Kyriakides, in charge of EU animal welfare legislation, has met with representatives of the \"End the Cage Age\" citizens' initiative. She expressed her support for investigating the initiative and finding ways to improve animal welfare. She emphasized the need for a balanced approach that takes into account the interests of farmers and considers economic, social, health, and environmental impacts. She assured that industry interests will not dominate the decision-making process and that the strong message from European citizens regarding animal rights and welfare will be respected.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \n\nIntroduction and background\nThis briefing note summarises the main remaining issues in the preparation of our draft proposal for the revised animal welfare regulation. Following the impact assessment concluded last year, a legislative proposal has been prepared and the inter-service consultation was recently concluded. We received positive opinions except for one negative opinion from DG AGRI, setting a condition regarding the preferred option for banning cages for laying hens.\n\nMain issues\nThe legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: \nrestricting the use of cages/crates;\nending the killing of day-old male chickens;\nbanning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and\nsetting animal welfare requirements at import.\n\nThe legislative proposal is based on the medium or high ambition option for all these measures. The cost-benefit analysis from the impact assessment showed that this would be the most efficient way forward. It is also in line with the outcomes of our stakeholder consultations and pressure from citizens. \n\nOther DGs support our draft proposal except when it comes to the ban on cages for laying hens. DG AGRI are concerned about the risk of unfair competition and raised food prices as a result of a cage ban. They therefore issued a negative opinion in the inter-service consultation. DG AGRI wants to see the low-ambition option (phase-in of a cage ban over 12 years) or even no legislative change at all, whereas the DG SANTE preferred option is the high-ambition option with phase-in over 5 years and no exceptions made. We would also like to see the ban combined with space requirements to ensure that free-range hens have sufficient living area. Sufficient space per animal is also needed for health and safety reasons including to minimise the risk of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nIt is true that this high-ambition option would have an impact on food pricing, though our impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. The main limitation is that poultry farmers will be able to house fewer birds per square meter. To some extent, farmers could be compensated for this via the Common Agricultural Policy or other economic incentives.\n\nFor small farmers, this seems not to be a main issue, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. In several Member States, the cage ban will also make no difference as they already adopted a ban within their national legislation. For internal market purposes, a cage ban would therefore help create a more level playing field.\n\nA more important problem is the competition with imported goods from third countries. This seems to be the real core concern of DG AGRI. Among our proposed options, we did propose to require stricter animal welfare rules also for imported animals and animal products, though our impact assessment implied that the medium ambition option would be the most cost-efficient choice.\n\nOptions for the way forward\nThere seems to be two main options for the way forward: compromise on the cage ban or compromise on the import rules.\n\nA compromise on the cage ban for laying hens would mean abandonning our preferred option to settle at the low or medium options instead. This would still be an improvement compared to the current situation. However, it is likely that the Commission would then be heavily criticised by NGOs as well as by the European Parliament who called for a total ban in shorter time. \n\nThe other possibility would be to focus instead on the real underlying problem raised by DG AGRI: the risk of unfair competition from third countries. DG AGRI have indicated that the transition time and exceptions for small farms are not the real problem, so a compromise solution on the cage ban proposal is not necessarily in their best interest. We could instead try to convince them to change their current position and accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages, in exchange for instead increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).\n\nThis would however require another round of talks also with DG TRADE who gave a positive opinion in the inter-service consultation. We have no information about their willingness to agree to such a compromise.\n\nConclusion\nOur recommendation is to, as a first priority, seek a compromise with DG AGRI based on stricter import rules. This would address their main concern while not compromising our preferred options or lowering the level of ambition for animal welfare.\n\nIf this fails, the fallback option could be to strike a compromise based on a longer phase-in period of the cage ban (low or medium ambition option).\n\nIf you agree to this plan of action, we can start informally consulting DG AGRI and DG TRADE immediately\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n1 June 202X\nTo the attention of the Director-General, Ms Heinrich,\nBriefing note\nSubject: Draft revised animal welfare regulation\nFacts\n- 300 millions farmed animals are confined in cages where they are treated as production machines. In some Member states (MS) of the European Union (EU), 90% of all hens and youg calves are kept in cages.\n- 170 organisations and caring citizens across Europe lead a European citizen's initiative to \"End the Cage Age\". They are gathring huge number of signatures: 1.4m. For reminder, the EC will considered the Europen Citizens' Initiative if (more details here):\n- it is composed of at least 7 EU citizens living in 7 different EU conuntries\n- and signed by one million citizens.\n- In April 20X-2, European Commission (EC) committed to propose legislation before end of 202X to finally prohibit the use of animal cages. Moreover, this legislation will also apply to imported products and the producer outside EU.\nSummary of the main issues\nFollowing the submission of the \"End the Cage Age\" initiative, the main issue raised by it:\nHow to ban the use of cage by farmers considering the impacts on environment, society and the single market ?\nEuropean Parliament (EP) recommended (558 MEPs in favour) a total ban on the use of cages in animal agriculture by 20X+3. Is it cost-efficiency to apply entirely this recommendation ? If yes, how long will be the transition period and how to reduce the impact on farmers during this period ?\nArguments\nNegative opinion\nMr Denker mentioned on 16/05/202x that low ambition option or staus quo should apply in order to ensure competitive pricing of EU food products vs third countries (with only minimum requirements)\nAccording to Mr Robinson (AGRI), the threshold of 50 livestocks units for exception is not justified. Indeed, the majority of eggs produced in the EU com from farms with mor than 71 livestocks unit. Moreover, longer transition will not change the situation. Consumers are looking for food prices and the decrease of space by banning the cages will increase the price. It could lead to more importation from countries with less animal welfare standards. Finally, without compensation for farmers, the current proposal will be blocked.\nWithout the cages, as several scientific studies pointed out, it prevails more antimicrobial resistance. More challenges related to biosecurity, use of antibiotics and more interaction will appear. To counter this, the hygiene routines and overall rules must be respected. The number of hens per square meter should be limited.\nPositive opinion\nOn 14/05/202X, Ms Svoboda wrote that our proposal is in line with European Green Deal objectives.\nEP propose to apply the same animal welfare standards to meat imported from outside EU as EU farmers (resolution from EP).\nIn order to smooth the transition period, some compensation and support for the transition to cage-free are necessary to EU farmers (awareness-raising vis-\u00e0-vis consumers, economic incentives,via the Common Agricultural Policy and import rules). This general transition period of between five and twelve years will be positive for all stakeholders thus a balanced and economically viable transition to cage-free farming.\nWe can make the animal welfare more attractive for EU farmers by offering economic incentives, subsidies, trade schemes and awareness campaigns.\nSofter values such as social, health and environmental impacts and ethical choices must be taken into consideration when preparing this proposal. Finally, animal rights and welfare could not be forgotten. We should respect them.\n \nRecommendations\nBanning totally the cage however a transition period is required in order to reduce the impact on EU farmers. This transition period is needed. EU farmers should reduce also financial compensation and EU consumers should be aware of impacts and efforts made. Finally, this rule should appy to\nFor next step, the EC should implement specific measures in some key related policy areas, as trade and research and innovation. Finance support and incentives provided by new Common Agricultural Policy are part of this process to upgrade facilities of farmers to a more animal-friendly system.\nI remain at your disposal for any questions.\nKind regards,\nSignature [my name]\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 3.0\n\n"}

Commission VP for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton met with representatives of these organizations to discuss the issue. Jourov\u00e1 will present her initiative at a press point, emphasizing the importance of fighting disinformation in the context of defending democracy and EU values.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: The Most Pressing Dangers of AI\n\nSummary: AI systems pose various risks and dangers that need to be addressed. These include techno-solutionism, which views AI as a panacea and can lead to larger problems; the adoption of a statistical perspective on justice, which can result in biased outcomes; the potential for disinformation and threats to democracy through AI manipulation; discrimination and risk in the medical setting; and the risks associated with generative AI, such as deepfakes and the spread of misinformation. The European Commission is proposing a regulatory framework on AI to address these risks and ensure the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses. Additionally, the EU is pushing for AI labels to identify AI-generated content and fight against deepfakes and disinformation.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \nPress point by Commission VP Jourova on generative AI\n10th of June 20XX at 11:15 \u2013 Charlemagne building (Room TBD) \n(INTRODUCTION)\nGood morning.\nWe are living in a Brave New World.\nGenerative AI is making breathtaking advances \u2014 from writing texts to creating ever more realistic pictures and videos.\nOver these last months we have been baffled by the exploits of ChatGTP and DALL.E, to the point that many of us in this room are fearing for their job in a not-so-distant future.\nBut there is more: generative AI will have enormous consequences not just for the future of our work, but for society, politics, and democracy. \nYesterday, Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton and myself have met representatives of 40-odd companies and organizations that have signed up to the EU\u2019s Code of Practice against disinformation. \nWe have asked them to come up with a clear labelling system to identify AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation. \nThe Commission wants to prevent artificial intelligence from blurring the lines between fact and fiction.\nToday, I would like to put this initiative in its wider context for you.\n(PAUSE)\n(WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI)\nNow, what exactly is generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\nGenerative AI generates outputs that appear authentic and human-like: text, images, graphics, music, etc.\nGenerative AI algorithms learn from training data that include examples of the desired output. \nBased on the patterns and structures within the training data, generative AI models can produce new content that shares characteristics with the original input data. \nThe most compelling advantage generative AI proposes is that it enables businesses to automate specific tasks and focus time, energy, and resources on more important strategic objectives:\nFor example, in content creation, generative AI can produce text, images and even music, assisting marketers, journalists, and artists with their creative processes. \nIn customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can provide more personalized assistance and reduce response times.\nGenerative AI is used in medicine to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs, saving time and money in research. \n\n(PAUSE)\n\n(THE DANGERS OF GENERATIVE AI)\nHowever, generative AI presents numerous issues requiring attention. \nOne major concern is its potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThe technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage. \nDisinformation poses serious threats to society, as it effectively changes and manipulates evidence to create social feedback loops that undermine any sense of objective truth. \nAI systems used to spread disinformation on the internet, can become a threat to society, politics, and democracy. \n(PAUSE)\n\n(LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON AI)\nSome two years ago, the European Commission began drafting the first-ever legal framework on AI, addressing the risks of AI and positioning Europe to play a leading role globally. \nA couple of weeks ago, this new Legal Framework on AI entered the co-decision stage. \nUnder the proposals, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level: from minimal through to limited, high, and unacceptable. \nWhile high-risk tools will not be banned, those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations.\nClearly, many generative AI systems belong in the high-risk category.\n(PAUSE)\n(NEW RULES FOR GENERATIVE AI)\nLast April, the European Union proposed new copyright rules for generative AI.\nCompanies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney, will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems.\nSome committee members initially proposed banning copyrighted material being used to train generative AI models altogether, but this was abandoned in favour of a transparency requirement.\nClear Labels. Services with a potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation should put in place technology to recognize such content and clearly label this to users. \nThe label should apply to all AI-generated material that can be used to create disinformation, including text, images, audio, and video.\nOn the other hand, services that integrate generative AI like Bingchat for Microsoft, Bard for Google should build in necessary safeguards that these services cannot be used by malicious actors to generate disinformation.\nFor now, labelling wouldn\u2019t be mandatory, given that it would be part of the voluntary Code of Practice. \nHowever, the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act (DSA). \nObligations on labeling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament, and the Commission.\n(CONCLUSION)\nAllow me to conclude this brief presentation now.\nGenerative AI has the potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThis poses a threat to our democratic society.\nThe EU is on the frontier of regulating AI technology and is now moving ahead to regulate generative AI.\n(PAUSE)\nI am now ready to answer your questions.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nINTRODUCTION\nThe purpose of this speaking note is to identify potential benefits and risks of generative AI, including the specific disinformation risk related to it. Furthermore, it will be shown as the EU addresses some issues created by the generative AI focusing on the importance of the fight against the disinformation in the context of defending democracy and the EU values.\nDEFINITION OF GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (GAI)\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence in which computer algorithms are used to generate outputs that resemble human-created content be it text images graphics music computer code or otherwise. Algorithms are designed to learn from training data that includes examples of the desired output.\nGENERATIVE AI AND THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS\nGenerative AI brings many advantages to business and entrepreneurs including: \nEfficiency because generative AI enables business to automate specific tasks and focus their time energy and resources on more important strategic objectives.\nAnalysis of data to improve decision-making.\nGeneration of new ideas, designs or content.\nWriting checking and optimizing computer code\nEnhance customer support with chatbots and virtual assistant.\nFurthermore, the generative AI can be used in various applications and industries, such as, for examples, in healthcare for accelerating the discovery of novel drugs and education for developing customized learning materials.\nGENERATIVE AI AND THE DISADVANTAGES\nIt increases the number of automation of tasks and therefore this situation affects the workforce and contribute to job displacement. In particular, the impacted employees are required to reskill or upskill.\nAI models can unintentionally learn and amplify biases present in training data, leading to problematic outputs that perpetuate stereotypes and harmful ideologies. The main issue in that regards is that it is difficult to scrutinize the sources used to train AI models.\nPrivacy since user data is often stored for model training and sensitive data can be exposed when interacting with generative AI.\nCybersecurity.\nCopyright issues because the AI models to generate output refer to a large database they were trained on. However, the original source and what can be used are not indicated.\nGENERATIVE AI AND THE DISINFORMATION RISK\nGenerative AI can contribute to spread misinformation or malicious or sensitive content that could result in damages for people and business.\nLarge language models, such as ChatGPT, make up facts. They are trained to predict the next word for a given input not whether a fact is correct or not. Furthermore, they are prone to mistake because of a misunderstanding of the prompt or a blatantly wring answer to the question since they rely on training and data to provide answers.\nConsidering the above, disinformation generated by generative AI can threat the security of the EU countries and the principle of democracy.  In particular, the technology can be used by criminals and extremists to manipulate people.\nEU PROPOSALS IN THE FIELD OF GENERATIVE AI\nAccording to an EU agreement, the European Union introduced new copyright rules for generative AI requiring companies developing generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop these tools.\nFollowing the above agreement, the Commission proposed the first-ever legal framework on AI, namely the AI Act as part of the wider AI package including the updated Coordinated Plan on AI. The aim of this proposal is, on the one hand, to provide AI developers, deployers and users with clear requirements and obligations regarding specific uses of AI and, on the other hand, to reduce administrative and financial burdens for business.\nAt the same time the proposal wants to guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and business in the field of AI. This will strengthen uptake investment and innovation in AI across EU.\nUnder the proposal, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level. In particular, 4 levels of risk in AI are identified:\nUnacceptable risk: all the AI systems having this level of risk are a clear threat to safety and they will be banned.\nHigh risk: All the AI systems having this level of risk are subject to strict obligations before thy can be put on the market.\nLimited risk: All the AI systems having this level of risk have specific transparency obligations.\nMinimal or no risk: All the AI systems having this level of risk o no risk are free use.\nCONCLUSION\nDespite the beneficial of the generative AI in real-world applications, there are still many risks which can be generated by it, affecting EU values and fundamental rights, as explained in the above paragraphs. However, the EU is trying to provide a relevant legislation framework to solve some of the issues raised by the generative AI. In that regard, the EU legislation seems to be considered a step forward to create a transparent, safe and non-discriminatory AI system in the EU.  Furthermore, it is necessary that the companies using the generative AI collaborate and apply the EU regulation to obtain results. They should adopt measures to avoid that disinformation can be spread by controlling the sources used to train the AI models. Considering that the AI is a fast-evolving technology it is also important that the EU regulation would be flexible enough to approach the future challenges of AI.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 8.8\n\n"}

This requires an effective legislative framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of legitimate concerns, the first of which is safety. |  | The blueprint outlines the proposed vision for U-space and how it could be rolled out. Rather than providing a definitive solution, this blueprint provides the basis to better define the way drones will operate in Europe in the future.   |  |  | OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS OF UNMANNED OR REMOTELY PILOTED VEHICLES IN THE EUROPEAN AIRSPACE |  | Drones have been used to shoot weddings, Hollywood movies and terrorists. But now drones are navigating a third path between hobbyists and warfare into the industrial world.  |  | New uses for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging almost daily: delivering packages, pizzas and blood; surveying mines; pre-emptive firefighting; and crime investigations.  |  | According to Gerald Van Hoy, senior research analyst at Gartner, 3 million drones are expected to be shipped this year, and this should translate into revenues of $6 Billion. However, drones pose an array of threats, and reports of drone-related accidents and near-misses are on the rise. Moreover, we can no longer rely on fences or barriers around our homes to protect our privacy and drones without adequate security in place will be vulnerable to hacks, as well as physical attacks.  |  | Theft of data is another real risk, particularly if the drone contains personal or sensitive information, whether this is customer data included for delivery purposes or footage collected via an attached camera.  |  | Accident liability and insurance related legislation is yet to be developed and public acceptance is key to the development of the industry. |  | U-SPACE \u2013 A BLUEPRINT FOR DRONE USE IN LOW-LEVEL AIRSPACE |  | U-space is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for large numbers of drones.  |  | These services rely on a high level of digitalisation and automation of functions, whether they are on board the drone itself or part of the ground-based environment.  |  | U-space provides an enabling framework to support routine drone operations, as well as a clear and effective interface to manned aviation. |  | The delivery of U-space relies upon the following key principles: | To ensure the safety of all airspace users operating in the U-space framework, as well as people on the ground. | To provide a scalable, flexible and adaptable system that can respond to changes in demand, volume, technology, business models and applications, while managing the interface with manned aviation. | To enable high-density operations with multiple automated drones under the supervision of fleet operators. | To guarantee equitable and fair access to airspace for all users. | To enable competitive and cost-effective service provision at all times, supporting the business models of drone operators. | To minimise deployment and operating costs by leveraging as much of the existing aeronautical services and infrastructure as possible, including GNSS as well as those from other sectors, such as mobile communication services. | To accelerate deployment by adopting technologies and standards from other sectors where they meet the needs of U-space. | To follow a risk-based and performance-driven approach when setting up appropriate requirements for safety, security and resilience, while minimising environmental impact and respecting the privacy of citizens, including data protection. |  | Subject to compliance with applicable regulations, operational limitations and technical requirements linked to the operation of the drone, U-space facilitates any kind of mission, from the delivery of goods, aerial work, and search and rescue, to more complex future applications such as urban air mobility. |  | U-space services are offered to both private and public users of drones, for all types of missions.  |  | In addition, the criticality of these services will lead to the establishment of performance requirements for both structural elements and service delivery, covering, for example, safety, security, availability, continuity and resilience. |  | NEXT STEPS |  | The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules that are proportionate to the risk of the operation.  | These rules will implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which the European Parliament and the Council (i.e. the EU Member States) are expected to adopt in the coming months. |  | The Commission, through the SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system. |  | CONCLUSIONS |  | The U-space framework comprises an extensive and scalable range of services relying on agreed EU standards and delivered by service providers.  |  | These services do not look to replicate the function of air traffic control. However, they do deliver key services to organise the safe and efficient operation of drones, ensuring a proper interface with manned aviation, ATC and relevant authorities.  |  |  |  | (signed) | <your name> | DG Mobility and Transport |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n16.06.20XX\n \n1. BACKGROUND \nThe demand for drone services is steadly incresing, with the potential to generate significant economic growth adn societal benefits. The EC is committed to deliver on its ambitious Aviation Strategy and unleash the full potential of drones in 20XX+2, therefore requiring an effective legislative framework able to foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing related concerns such as safety. In this context, on the 16th of June 20XX the Single European Sky Air traffic management Research Joint Udertaking published a blueprint, which intends to make drone use in low-level airspace safe, secure and enivronmentally friendly. \n \n2. UNMANNED OR REMOTELY PILOTED VEHICLES IN THE EUROPEAN AIRSPACE: OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS\nThere are opportunities and threats related to unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles. The main opportunities refer to:\na. Sustaniable jobs and new prospects for growth both for manufacturing industry and potentially all involved sectors of society;\nb. New services and applications, while performing existing services in a more affordable and environmentally friendly way.\nFor instance, drones can be been used to help in the fight against crime, searching for missing people, gathering evidence from road traffic investigations. They can also be used in other domains, such as to shoot weddings, Hollywood movies, to deliver packages, pizzas and blood. As a matter of fact, new uses for drones are emerging on a daily basis. \n \nOn the other side, the main threats refers to the followind areas:\na. The respect of citizens' fundamental rights, such as the right of privacy and the protection of personal data.\nb. The integration of drones into the aviation system.\nc. Drones may cause noice.\nd.

She assured that industry interests will not dominate the decision-making process and that the strong message from European citizens regarding animal rights and welfare will be respected.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \n\nIntroduction and background\nThis briefing note summarises the main remaining issues in the preparation of our draft proposal for the revised animal welfare regulation. Following the impact assessment concluded last year, a legislative proposal has been prepared and the inter-service consultation was recently concluded. We received positive opinions except for one negative opinion from DG AGRI, setting a condition regarding the preferred option for banning cages for laying hens.\n\nMain issues\nThe legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: \nrestricting the use of cages/crates;\nending the killing of day-old male chickens;\nbanning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and\nsetting animal welfare requirements at import.\n\nThe legislative proposal is based on the medium or high ambition option for all these measures. The cost-benefit analysis from the impact assessment showed that this would be the most efficient way forward. It is also in line with the outcomes of our stakeholder consultations and pressure from citizens. \n\nOther DGs support our draft proposal except when it comes to the ban on cages for laying hens. DG AGRI are concerned about the risk of unfair competition and raised food prices as a result of a cage ban. They therefore issued a negative opinion in the inter-service consultation. DG AGRI wants to see the low-ambition option (phase-in of a cage ban over 12 years) or even no legislative change at all, whereas the DG SANTE preferred option is the high-ambition option with phase-in over 5 years and no exceptions made. We would also like to see the ban combined with space requirements to ensure that free-range hens have sufficient living area. Sufficient space per animal is also needed for health and safety reasons including to minimise the risk of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nIt is true that this high-ambition option would have an impact on food pricing, though our impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. The main limitation is that poultry farmers will be able to house fewer birds per square meter. To some extent, farmers could be compensated for this via the Common Agricultural Policy or other economic incentives.\n\nFor small farmers, this seems not to be a main issue, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. In several Member States, the cage ban will also make no difference as they already adopted a ban within their national legislation. For internal market purposes, a cage ban would therefore help create a more level playing field.\n\nA more important problem is the competition with imported goods from third countries. This seems to be the real core concern of DG AGRI. Among our proposed options, we did propose to require stricter animal welfare rules also for imported animals and animal products, though our impact assessment implied that the medium ambition option would be the most cost-efficient choice.\n\nOptions for the way forward\nThere seems to be two main options for the way forward: compromise on the cage ban or compromise on the import rules.\n\nA compromise on the cage ban for laying hens would mean abandonning our preferred option to settle at the low or medium options instead. This would still be an improvement compared to the current situation. However, it is likely that the Commission would then be heavily criticised by NGOs as well as by the European Parliament who called for a total ban in shorter time. \n\nThe other possibility would be to focus instead on the real underlying problem raised by DG AGRI: the risk of unfair competition from third countries. DG AGRI have indicated that the transition time and exceptions for small farms are not the real problem, so a compromise solution on the cage ban proposal is not necessarily in their best interest. We could instead try to convince them to change their current position and accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages, in exchange for instead increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).\n\nThis would however require another round of talks also with DG TRADE who gave a positive opinion in the inter-service consultation. We have no information about their willingness to agree to such a compromise.\n\nConclusion\nOur recommendation is to, as a first priority, seek a compromise with DG AGRI based on stricter import rules. This would address their main concern while not compromising our preferred options or lowering the level of ambition for animal welfare.\n\nIf this fails, the fallback option could be to strike a compromise based on a longer phase-in period of the cage ban (low or medium ambition option).\n\nIf you agree to this plan of action, we can start informally consulting DG AGRI and DG TRADE immediately\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nBRIEFING NOTE \nINTRODUCTION \nThe issue is the proposal for a new Regulation on animal welfare that comes after a citizen initiative coordinated by 170 NGOs supported by a petition signed by more than 1.7 Million EU Citizens. This has been supported by the European Parliament through the adoption by a large majority of a resolution which demands the phasing out of cages on farms. The new regulation should ensure better living condition of selected species and categories of animals. The measure will have some implications on the economy, as farms will have to sustain the costs to adapt to the new standards and this might ultimately affect prices. \nISSUE AND POSSIBLE OPTIONS \nThe measure essentially focuses on:\n1. the phasing out of cages/crates for pigs, calves, laying hens and pullets, and rabbits and fur-producing animals. A phasing out period between five and ten years. \n2. banning the killing of day-old chicks, with an obligation of marking eggs. If combined with stricter import rules, a period of five years should be sufficient.  \n3. banning painful mutilations. with incentives for complying farms, with a transition period of ten years.\n4. welfare requirements at imports. Either similar of fully equivalent standards with a possible transition period of 5 to 10 years.\nWhile all DGs agree on the proposal, DG AGRI has expressed a negative opinion in particular on the issue of phasing out cages for hens, production of eggs and the risks for prices to raise. Insofar, this remains the main issue at stake. \nFurthermore, EFSA has expressed concerns over a cage-free environment given the increased risk of anti-microbial resistance of animals and the consequent more important use of antibiotics. \nThe estimated economic impact of cage-free system would be around 2,4-2,8 Million EUR. \nWhile the EC has committed to present a proposal by the end of the year, a decision has to be made on: \n1. the time-span of implementation of the measures (5 to 12 years)\n3. the entity of subsidies (probably under the new CAP)\n2. the animal standards requirements at imports. \n \nRECOMMENDATION\nThe primary objective is to preserve as much as possible the draft Regulation as it aligns with DG SANTE's policy objectives. The main obstacle would be to give some concessions in order to bring onboard DG AGRI and  being able to present the legislative initiative to the Council and Parliament as committed. \nIt is clear that DG AGRI is open to compromise if we respond to their concern on the costs of the measure and the risk of raising prices. \nI suggest first of all, to stress that in MS where these measures have already been implemented, cage-free eggs production has not brought to a high price increase for the consumers, and in the long-run the costs are equivalent to cage-produced eggs.\nSecond, there is only a minority of MS that relies on a heavy production of cage-produced eggs. The Commission could respond to their concerns with two possible measures: \n1. Provide incentives from the CAP to their phasing out, but we should mantain the foreseen timespan of five years, not to move too much away from the European Parliament proposal (3 years);\n2. Introduce stricter rules for eggs import, with an obligation to have the same standards as EU. \nThese measures will help mitigate the costs addressing DG AGRI's major concern.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 6.0\n\n"}

The legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of batteries, from raw material supply chain to production, reuse, and recycling. The proposal aligns with the European Green Deal, Circular Economy Action Plan, and New Industrial Strategy. The Council and European Parliament have reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. An internal reflection and brainstorming meeting is planned to fine-tune the original proposal in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to build a resilient lithium supply chain\n\nSummary: Europe is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for lithium, a key metal used in batteries for electric vehicles. The European Union (EU) plans to release its Critical Raw Materials Act, which will identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk. The EU aims to become climate neutral by 2050 and has set ambitious goals for the electrification of transportation. However, challenges faced by carmakers and concerns about supply availability and access to raw materials continue to impact the growth of the electric vehicle market in Europe.\n\nHeadline: European Commission considers classifying lithium as toxic\n\nSummary: The European Commission is considering a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If approved, this classification could undermine the EU's efforts to create a domestic battery materials supply chain. The EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium for its electric vehicle production sector, and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions. The proposal could have an impact on lithium mining, processing, cathode production, and recycling.\n\nHeadline: The Inflation Reduction Act stimulates battery mineral mining in the US\n\nSummary: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US is expected to stimulate a \"gold rush\" in battery mineral mining, refining, and production. The IRA offers tax credits for various stages of battery production and the battery supply chain, making it more appealing for companies to bring full-cycle battery production to the US. This includes mining and refining battery minerals, producing battery cells, and battery pack production. The IRA aims to reduce the US's dependence on China for battery minerals and increase domestic production.\n\nHeadline: Russia plans to start lithium mining in the next few years\n\nSummary: Russia is planning to start lithium mining based on ore deposits in the Murmansk region within the next three to four years. The country has significant lithium reserves, accounting for 10% of the world's reserves. The demand for lithium is expected to increase in the next decade, and Russia aims to become one of the world's top five producers of lithium. The next stage of Russia's lithium industry development will be the application of technologies for lithium production from solutions found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields.\n\nHeadline: Meeting the growing demand for lithium in the electric vehicle industry\n\nSummary: The demand for lithium is expected to rise significantly due to the growing electric vehicle industry. Despite the expected increase in demand, the lithium industry is expected to provide enough supply to meet the needs of the lithium-ion battery industry. In addition to increasing conventional lithium supply, new technologies such as direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP) offer promise in increasing supply, reducing the industry's environmental impact, and lowering costs. Battery recycling is also expected to increase, providing a secondary supply of lithium.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the Case Study. \nMemo | Regulation on batteries and waste batteries | In December 20XX-2, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on batteries and waste batteries. The proposal aims to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery life cycle. The initiative is closely linked to the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the New Industrial Strategy.  | At the end of last year, The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. For the first time the legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of a battery \u2013 from the supply chain of raw materials, over the production to reuse and recycling of batteries \u2013 and ensure that they are safe, sustainable, and competitive. | The purpose of this memo is to launch the interservice consultation procedure for the new Regulation on Batteries and waste batteries. It is intended to structure the review of the original proposal, considering the observations of the Council and the European Parliament, and to further materialize the specific requirements by setting measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based targets and objectives. |  | Context | The European Union (EU) has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Recently proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035. | As sales of electric vehicles increase, carmakers are looking to secure supply of key metals used in batteries, including lithium. Today, Europe is quite dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply and China for lithium refining. While only around 9% of the world's lithium is mined in China, around 60% is refined there. | With expected battery lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles, and the possibility of extending EV battery life through use in the energy-storage sector, battery recycling is expected to increase during the current decade, but not to game-changing levels. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. By 2030, such secondary supply is expected to account for slightly more than 6 percent of total lithium production. | Although Europe is pushing to build a resilient supply chain by partnering with allies and developing domestic resources, it might not all be good news for miners in the region \u2014 at the end of last year, the European Commission said it will weigh a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, recycling, and handling of the materials.  |  | Agenda | General  | The new regulation should apply to all batteries including all waste portable batteries, electric vehicle batteries, industrial batteries, starting, lightning and ignition batteries, and batteries for light means of transport (e.g., electric bikes, e-mopeds, e-scooters). | Supply chain of raw materials | EU needs to boost its local mining and refining capacity and shift more towards trustworthy suppliers.  | Target for local mining: cover the EU needs for XX% by 20XX+Y.  | Due diligence of raw materials\u2019 origin, carbon intensity requirements and more efficient use of raw materials. Target date: end of 20XX+Y. Possible exemption for SMEs from the due diligence rules (to be discussed). | Refinery: More recycled content in new batteries second life for industrial batteries. Targets for producers to collect waste portable batteries (XX% by the end of 20XX+Y). Introduction of dedicated collection objective for waste batteries for light means of transport (YY% by the end of 20XX+Y). | Market: Promote a circular battery industry, market for secondary raw materials, clearer labelling, and information with \u201cbattery passports\u201d and QR codes | End of use: Strict collection schemes and recycling targets, better ways of re-using old batteries, battery traceability, more efficient recycling of waste batteries, ensure the environmentally sound treatment of waste batteries, incentives for further recycling. | Production of batteries in the EU | 20XX+1: additional investment of \u20acXX billion in R&D for European battery production and electric cars. | Targets: by 20XX+Y Local producers cover the EU's demand and by 20XX+Y, EU produces next generation battery and EV technologies.  | By 20XX+Y, the EU sets a global sustainable standard in the global market. | Functioning of the internal market  | The new rules aim to improve the functioning of the internal market for batteries and ensure fairer competition. This will be reached through performance, durability and safety criteria, tight restrictions for hazardous substances like mercury, cadmium and lead and mandatory information on the carbon footprint of batteries. The regulation also introduces labelling and information requirements, among other things on the battery's components and recycled content, and an electronic \u201cbattery passport\u201d and a QR code. | Setting of a realistic implementation schedule.\u00a0Notably, labelling requirements will apply after XX months after entry into force of the Regulation and after XX months for the QR code. |  |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nFor: Ferdinand Porsche (HoU DG MOVE)\n01/03/2023\nINTERNAL MEETING MEMO on sustainable, circular, European battery supply chain\nFACTS\nEU legislation is to ban combustion engine cars by 2035, plan with net-zero economy, climate neutral by 2050.\nImpossible to detach fuly from Chinese lithium-ion supply, but as the lithium processing companies are mostly EU-based dependency on China will improve. Lithium refining done mostly in China, cathodes produced there as well, mineral concentrate in Australia. China has years of advancement of supply chain and know how in the field.\nOutlook on less China dependency is thus more long term and legislation against China is therefore not likely to not hamper EU market development. EU has real potential to become self sufficient as regards raw materials via recycling in addtion to domestic supply.\nHowever, last year EU Commisions was considering ESHA proposal to classify lithium as toxic - bad news for EU mining, specifically for lithium mining, processing, cathode production and recycling.\nThis brings problems in factries in Portugal and Germany, and also in Serbia.\nImportant development in the US in connection with Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which has incentivised the whole battery cycle through tax credits. The attractiveness of this package is in stacking of bonuses (credits) on all steps of production of batteries, from refining to putting together of battery packs; and 50% pricing control on raw materials, all of which produces long term incentives.This creates attractiveness for companies to move business to the US, to have the whole process done in the US as the bonuses are linked to purely US based manufacture and assembly.\nRussia has 10% of raw materials, so the EU could consider this source.\nDirect lithium extraction (DLE) and DL product could provide for 10% of demannd of lithium supply by 2030, recycling of batteries could provide for 6% by the same date. Batteries will represent 95% of total demand of lithium by 2030.\n \nAGENDA FOR INTERNAL MEETING\nPROPOSALS/RECOMMENDATIONS in line with political priorities\n1) Strong support of lithium mining from geothermal sources due to lack of health hazard\n2) Legislation aimed at gradual cessation of supply of lithium-ion from Asia whilst increasing EU based supply via recycling and non-hazardous sources.\n3) Introduction of incentivisation of producers similar to US, for example 10 Eur per kwh, 10 Eur per cell assembly etc,, to attract companies and create strong base in long term.\n4) Increase supply from Chile, Argentina, Australia in shot and medium term.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 4.0\n\n"}

She assured that industry interests will not dominate the decision-making process and that the strong message from European citizens regarding animal rights and welfare will be respected.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \n\nIntroduction and background\nThis briefing note summarises the main remaining issues in the preparation of our draft proposal for the revised animal welfare regulation. Following the impact assessment concluded last year, a legislative proposal has been prepared and the inter-service consultation was recently concluded. We received positive opinions except for one negative opinion from DG AGRI, setting a condition regarding the preferred option for banning cages for laying hens.\n\nMain issues\nThe legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: \nrestricting the use of cages/crates;\nending the killing of day-old male chickens;\nbanning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and\nsetting animal welfare requirements at import.\n\nThe legislative proposal is based on the medium or high ambition option for all these measures. The cost-benefit analysis from the impact assessment showed that this would be the most efficient way forward. It is also in line with the outcomes of our stakeholder consultations and pressure from citizens. \n\nOther DGs support our draft proposal except when it comes to the ban on cages for laying hens. DG AGRI are concerned about the risk of unfair competition and raised food prices as a result of a cage ban. They therefore issued a negative opinion in the inter-service consultation. DG AGRI wants to see the low-ambition option (phase-in of a cage ban over 12 years) or even no legislative change at all, whereas the DG SANTE preferred option is the high-ambition option with phase-in over 5 years and no exceptions made. We would also like to see the ban combined with space requirements to ensure that free-range hens have sufficient living area. Sufficient space per animal is also needed for health and safety reasons including to minimise the risk of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nIt is true that this high-ambition option would have an impact on food pricing, though our impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. The main limitation is that poultry farmers will be able to house fewer birds per square meter. To some extent, farmers could be compensated for this via the Common Agricultural Policy or other economic incentives.\n\nFor small farmers, this seems not to be a main issue, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. In several Member States, the cage ban will also make no difference as they already adopted a ban within their national legislation. For internal market purposes, a cage ban would therefore help create a more level playing field.\n\nA more important problem is the competition with imported goods from third countries. This seems to be the real core concern of DG AGRI. Among our proposed options, we did propose to require stricter animal welfare rules also for imported animals and animal products, though our impact assessment implied that the medium ambition option would be the most cost-efficient choice.\n\nOptions for the way forward\nThere seems to be two main options for the way forward: compromise on the cage ban or compromise on the import rules.\n\nA compromise on the cage ban for laying hens would mean abandonning our preferred option to settle at the low or medium options instead. This would still be an improvement compared to the current situation. However, it is likely that the Commission would then be heavily criticised by NGOs as well as by the European Parliament who called for a total ban in shorter time. \n\nThe other possibility would be to focus instead on the real underlying problem raised by DG AGRI: the risk of unfair competition from third countries. DG AGRI have indicated that the transition time and exceptions for small farms are not the real problem, so a compromise solution on the cage ban proposal is not necessarily in their best interest. We could instead try to convince them to change their current position and accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages, in exchange for instead increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).\n\nThis would however require another round of talks also with DG TRADE who gave a positive opinion in the inter-service consultation. We have no information about their willingness to agree to such a compromise.\n\nConclusion\nOur recommendation is to, as a first priority, seek a compromise with DG AGRI based on stricter import rules. This would address their main concern while not compromising our preferred options or lowering the level of ambition for animal welfare.\n\nIf this fails, the fallback option could be to strike a compromise based on a longer phase-in period of the cage ban (low or medium ambition option).\n\nIf you agree to this plan of action, we can start informally consulting DG AGRI and DG TRADE immediately\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nNote to the Director - General Ms. Heinrich\n                                                                                                                                     \n \n         Thursday, 1 June 202X\n \n \nSubject: Animal welfare regulation state of the play and way forward\n \nThis note aims to describe the state of the play of the animal welfare regulation, provide arguments in favour and against the different policies options and suggest the way forward for the DG.\n1. STATE OF THE PLAY OF ANIMAL WELFARE, CHALLENGES AND LEGAL LANDSCAPE\n1.1. Drivers to the current animal welfare problems\nDifferent drivers are involved compromising the animal welfare, such as pressure to reduce production costs, lack of incentives to invest, outdated legislation and fragmented legal landscape. All these factors influence the current problems of animal welfare, such as harmful practices and stunning methods for animals, excess of breeding, lack of monitoring and enforcement. Consequently, animal welfare are compromised with a negative impact on the single market.\nLast but not least, societal demands are not met, with citizens concerns increasing on ethics and sustainability of animals.\n 1.2. Legal landscape\nOn the legal landscape, the actual legislation requires laying hens be kept either in enriches caes, or alternative systems. The current legislation allows calves being individually housed, while sows and gilts are kept in confinement. There is a trend towards using less cages in many EU Member States (MS), while others have already banned the use of cages. In the current scenario, if no action is taken at EU level, the animal welfare problems related to cages will remain.\nTwo years ago, the EP (European Parliament) voted on a resolution recommending a total ban on the use of cages in animals by 202x=3. As stated by Commissioner Kyriakides, the phase-out would happen \"as soon as feasible\". To make this happen, we propose the following policy options following the economic and environmental impact of the banning.\n2. WAY FORWARD\n2. 1. Policies recommended\nFollowing an impact assessment including cost-efficiency, environmental and societal impacts and impacts on the single market. The most cost-efficient options have been suggested which range from high to medium ambition options, namely:\n- phasing out confining ages/crates in over five years for pigs, calves, laying hens, pullets and rabbits.This transition period would be from the date of entry into force of the revised legislation.\n- phasing out within 10 years: killing of day-old male chickens, painful mutilations, animal welfare requirements at import.\n2.2. Arguments in favour of the recommended policies\nTwo main arguments in favour of these policy recommendations. First, they are the most positive in terms of cost-efficiency as per the risk assessment. Also from the risk assessment, it must be highligted that these policies are between the high-medium level of ambition.\nSecondly, another positive impact would be on the environmental side, since less intensive production would lead to less air and water pollution and less greenhouse gass emissions. \nAnother report quantifying the cost-efficiency and environmental aspects of the recommended policies is being developed, jointly with the other DGs working on the file.\nOn a separate note, all DGs are in favour of these policy recommendations, except DG AGRI, therefore, an action plan to continue the negotiations with DG AGRI is being developed, jointly with the rest of the agreeing DGs.\n2.3. Arguments against the recommended policies\nThe main caveats against these policy options are:\n-  if no similar requirement apply for eggs and egg products imported into the EU, an increase in eggs obtained from caged hens imported from non-EU cuntries is expected, thus limiting the positive animal welfare impact of the measure.\n- this prohibition of cages would decrease the number of laying hens by an estimated 30% (from 186,8 to 102,9 million).\n- the required investment for a transition to a cage-free system for laying hens would be 2,4-2,8  billion Euros.\n- the price of eggs would increase for consumers (up to a 20% difference in some sales data, to be further analyzed).\n2.4. Way forward\nBased on the technical analyses conducted, we strongly recommend the policies options above, since the environmental and cost-efficiency reasons seem to be solid and count with the public opinion.\nThis recommendation prevails if we look at the negotiations performed with the other DGs. With most of DGs being in favour of these policy recommendations. Regarding the different point of view of DG AGRI, an action plan to continue the negotiations with DG AGRI will be drafted this week jointly with the rest of the agreeing DGs. \nOnce we have your opinion on this proposition, we would be able to timely move ahead with the required actions (which include the discussions with DG AGRI).\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 6.0\n\n"}

Commission VP for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton met with representatives of these organizations to discuss the issue. Jourov\u00e1 will present her initiative at a press point, emphasizing the importance of fighting disinformation in the context of defending democracy and EU values.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: The Most Pressing Dangers of AI\n\nSummary: AI systems pose various risks and dangers that need to be addressed. These include techno-solutionism, which views AI as a panacea and can lead to larger problems; the adoption of a statistical perspective on justice, which can result in biased outcomes; the potential for disinformation and threats to democracy through AI manipulation; discrimination and risk in the medical setting; and the risks associated with generative AI, such as deepfakes and the spread of misinformation. The European Commission is proposing a regulatory framework on AI to address these risks and ensure the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses. Additionally, the EU is pushing for AI labels to identify AI-generated content and fight against deepfakes and disinformation.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \nPress point by Commission VP Jourova on generative AI\n10th of June 20XX at 11:15 \u2013 Charlemagne building (Room TBD) \n(INTRODUCTION)\nGood morning.\nWe are living in a Brave New World.\nGenerative AI is making breathtaking advances \u2014 from writing texts to creating ever more realistic pictures and videos.\nOver these last months we have been baffled by the exploits of ChatGTP and DALL.E, to the point that many of us in this room are fearing for their job in a not-so-distant future.\nBut there is more: generative AI will have enormous consequences not just for the future of our work, but for society, politics, and democracy. \nYesterday, Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton and myself have met representatives of 40-odd companies and organizations that have signed up to the EU\u2019s Code of Practice against disinformation. \nWe have asked them to come up with a clear labelling system to identify AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation. \nThe Commission wants to prevent artificial intelligence from blurring the lines between fact and fiction.\nToday, I would like to put this initiative in its wider context for you.\n(PAUSE)\n(WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI)\nNow, what exactly is generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\nGenerative AI generates outputs that appear authentic and human-like: text, images, graphics, music, etc.\nGenerative AI algorithms learn from training data that include examples of the desired output. \nBased on the patterns and structures within the training data, generative AI models can produce new content that shares characteristics with the original input data. \nThe most compelling advantage generative AI proposes is that it enables businesses to automate specific tasks and focus time, energy, and resources on more important strategic objectives:\nFor example, in content creation, generative AI can produce text, images and even music, assisting marketers, journalists, and artists with their creative processes. \nIn customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can provide more personalized assistance and reduce response times.\nGenerative AI is used in medicine to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs, saving time and money in research. \n\n(PAUSE)\n\n(THE DANGERS OF GENERATIVE AI)\nHowever, generative AI presents numerous issues requiring attention. \nOne major concern is its potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThe technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage. \nDisinformation poses serious threats to society, as it effectively changes and manipulates evidence to create social feedback loops that undermine any sense of objective truth. \nAI systems used to spread disinformation on the internet, can become a threat to society, politics, and democracy. \n(PAUSE)\n\n(LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON AI)\nSome two years ago, the European Commission began drafting the first-ever legal framework on AI, addressing the risks of AI and positioning Europe to play a leading role globally. \nA couple of weeks ago, this new Legal Framework on AI entered the co-decision stage. \nUnder the proposals, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level: from minimal through to limited, high, and unacceptable. \nWhile high-risk tools will not be banned, those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations.\nClearly, many generative AI systems belong in the high-risk category.\n(PAUSE)\n(NEW RULES FOR GENERATIVE AI)\nLast April, the European Union proposed new copyright rules for generative AI.\nCompanies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney, will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems.\nSome committee members initially proposed banning copyrighted material being used to train generative AI models altogether, but this was abandoned in favour of a transparency requirement.\nClear Labels. Services with a potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation should put in place technology to recognize such content and clearly label this to users. \nThe label should apply to all AI-generated material that can be used to create disinformation, including text, images, audio, and video.\nOn the other hand, services that integrate generative AI like Bingchat for Microsoft, Bard for Google should build in necessary safeguards that these services cannot be used by malicious actors to generate disinformation.\nFor now, labelling wouldn\u2019t be mandatory, given that it would be part of the voluntary Code of Practice. \nHowever, the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act (DSA). \nObligations on labeling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament, and the Commission.\n(CONCLUSION)\nAllow me to conclude this brief presentation now.\nGenerative AI has the potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThis poses a threat to our democratic society.\nThe EU is on the frontier of regulating AI technology and is now moving ahead to regulate generative AI.\n(PAUSE)\nI am now ready to answer your questions.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nSpeaking Note to Commissioner Thierry Breton\n9 June 20XX, DG Internal Market\nTitle: The Commissions standpoint to generative AI (GAI)\n \nDefining GAI:\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is a subfield of an artificial intelligence (AI) system. It can generate computer algorithms, texts, images, and music. GAI learns from training data that includes examples of desired output. \nExamples of GAI are:\nChatGPT is an AI language model that can generate human-like text based on given prompts.\nMidjourney interprets text prompts and context to produce images and artwork.\n \nPotential Benefits of GAI:\nGAI increases efficiancy, enables businesses to automate specific tasks and increase operational efficiency. It further customises marketing content, optimizing computer code, draft templates for all kind of written texts.\nPotential Risks of GAI:\nFive specific risks exist regarding GAI:\nHallucinations: GAI uses training data. The training data can lead to biased or incorrect responses, which is a serious probelm when people rely on it.\nDeepfakes: GAI creates videos and fotos and voice recording that may be abused to attack politicians and activits, spread misleading information. GAI may further create fake accounts and take over existing legitimate accounts. Disinformation through GAI is a serious risk for democracy. Deepfake videos and online bots may spread fake news and manipulate public discourse and social trust.\nData privacy: GAI user data is often stored for model training. Therefore, employees may easily expose sensitive and proprietary entreprise data. The GAI applications may indefinitely store information and even train other GAI models with it, further compromising confidentiality.\nCybersecurity: Computer hackers could abuse GAI applications to code computer viruse or other harmful software.\nCopyright issues: GAI models use big amounts of internet data sharing content that has not been explicitly shared by the original soruce. This is problematic for music and videos that have a copyright.\n \nOptions to address risks:\nThe EU has understood that fighting against desinformation in context of defending democracy and EU values is very important. Therefore, the European Commission proposes the first-ever regulatory framework on AI, namely the AI act, to address risks of AI and position Europe to play a leading role on AI globally. The existing legislation is not sufficient to address specific challenges AI systems may bring.\nThe new regulatory framework under the AI act defines 4 levels of risks unacceptable risk: high risk, limited risk, minimal risk. The EU lists GAI such as chatbots in the category of limited risk. In that case users need to be made aware that they are interacting with a machine so they can take an informed decision to continue or step back. \nThe regulation further proposes a conformity assessment before the AI system is put into service or placed on the market. GAI companies will have to disclose any copyright material used to develop their systems. Moreover, they will have to indentify and label AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation.\nNext steps\nThe commission propsed the AI Act to regulate high risk applications and ban most dangerous ones. But even before the act enters into force, the Commission will make it mandatory for the GAI industry to label AI generated work.\nSigning Code of Practice by big tech comapnies including Microsoft, Google, Meta and Tiktok against desinformation. The Code of Practice will ask signatories to create a dedicated track within the code to indentify specific disinformation risks by GAI and take appropriate measures to address them. The Commission plans to make the code enforcable by including a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act. Labelling AI contact may also enter the AI act.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 6.8\n\n"}

Additionally, driverless cars will eliminate the need for traffic lights and other infrastructure, and will lead to the development of lighter and more fuel-efficient vehicles. However, the adoption of driverless cars also raises challenges in terms of establishing EU-wide liability rules, adapting the legal and regulatory framework, ensuring data privacy and cyber security, and addressing liability issues in case of malfunctions.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the Case Study. \n\n1. INTRODUCTION |  | Automated vehicle technologies allow the transfer of driving functions from a human driver to a computer. Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility. As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure. Vehicle automation also has the potential to be more environmentally friendly, efficient and accessible. |  | 2. POTENTIAL AND CHALLENGES OF VEHICLE AUTOMATION |  | Few people seem to fully grasp the profound improvement in our lives that driverless cars will bring: |  | According to the European Commission, automated driving will increase road safety significantly, as human error is involved in more than 90% of all traffic accidents on Europe's roads.  | Self-driving cars will remove a lot of vehicles from city streets because self-driving cars won\u2019t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers. | Because fewer shared vehicles will be necessary to provide the same service that personally owned vehicles provide there will be a substantial reduction in the cost of car ownership. | With no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient.  | Self-driving cars will also benefit other groups who currently cannot drive an individual car; children, elderly people or people with a disability. |  | However, the deployment of automated vehicles raises many questions around ethical, legal, financial, economic and technical implications: |  | Established rules for this technology have not yet been put in place, in particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed and it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom.   | In case of malfunction of an automated vehicle it is not clear as to who is liable when such malfunctions result in an accident: the manufacturer, the owner or the driver. | The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of traffic rules, driving education and licensing. | The growing use of vehicle automation also raises ethical issues, for example with privacy and safety.  | There will be a tremendous impact on the workforce, not only by taking away jobs from drivers but also by requiring different qualifications and skill sets of workers in the car industry. | The transition period during which human-driven cars and automated cars will be sharing the roads will extend over several decades. |  | 3. DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTOMATION AND THEIR DEPLOYMENT |  | For an effective communication between the technological and political spheres, categorisation and terminology are being developed which define different levels of vehicle automation. |  | Currently, different ways of categorising the levels of automation exist in parallel, but many organisations follow the classification set by the International Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE): |  | Level 0: Park Distance Control - The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals. | Level 1: Park Assist - The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces.  | Level 2: Traffic Jam Assist - The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h).  | Level 3: Traffic Jam Chauffeur - Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads.  | Level 4: Highway Pilot - Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. | Level 5: Fully automated vehicle - The vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger.  |  | As of today, levels 0 to 3 are already deployed on our roads, level 4 will become available over the next few years and for level 5 only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10. |  | 4. REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS - STATE OF PLAY |  | The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968 ('Vienna Convention of 1968') is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety by establishing standard traffic rules among the contracting parties. All EU Member States are signatories of the Vienna Convention \u2013 only the UK and Spain have not endorsed it.  |  | One of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. It is a very long and slow process to change treaties on the UN level, therefore the EU might take the lead in updating legislation and the UN can follow later.  |  | 5. ONGOING WORK IN THE EU |  | The European Union and its Member States participate in international working groups which are revising the regulations as prerequisites for the deployment of automated vehicles. Technical requirements for vehicles are internationally harmonised in the framework of the two following UNECE Agreements: |  | The 1958 Agreement provides the framework for establishing international UN Regulations with uniform performance\u2014oriented test provisions and administrative procedures for granting type approvals, for the conformity of production and for the mutual recognition of the type approvals granted.  | The 1998 Agreement concerns the establishing of global technical regulations for the construction of new vehicles, including performance requirements. Its purpose is to further enhance the process of international harmonisation through the development of global technical regulations (GTR).  |  | The common legal framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers is provided by a Framework Directive. Within the EU, mass-produced cars may only be used on public roads if they are type-approved in compliance with the administrative procedures and technical requirements established by the Directive. |  | The regulatory environment relating to cyber security and data privacy is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles. The new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regards to digital technologies - including vehicle automation, valid across the EU. |  | In the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products. However, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved \u2014 the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States. |  | Furthermore, the European Union is funding research on automated road transport as a priority in the Horizon 2020 Transport Research programme.  |  |  | 6. CONCLUSION |  | Road traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness in the ever-globalising world. |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n16 November 20XX\nBriefing note: Driverless cars and vehicle automation in the EU\n. Potential and challenges of vehicle automation\nThe adoption of driverless cars may decrease car accidents and fatalities, it may remove up to half of the vehicles from cyty streets, and car sharinig will cost a fraction of what car ownershi today costs. Specific social groups such as disabled people, women and children will benefit to have a on-demand driver available both day and night. Insurance discrimination or bias in police checks will be eliminated. Cars will also be desinged in a completely different way, and technologiacl improvements may push the creation of new high-skilled jobs in the automotive industry. \nHowever, the Study Service of the European Parliament highlight many ethical, financial, economic, and technical challenges. The scientific discussion focused on technologial issues, but it recently shifted to user acceptance and legal issues. Questions about how data privacy and cybersecurity need to be addressed thoroughly. Ethical issues regarding the data processing of the algorithm of a highly or fully automated vehicle. potential issues may be how the angorigthm take  a decision in an unavoidable crash scenario. How the system will develop its \"best driving behaviour\". There may be liability issues in case of malfunctioning of an automated vehicle.\nA possible social impact of automated cars on the job market is a job loss by professional drivers, as cited by Anita Balakrishnan in her article for CNBC of May 22, 20XX. A Goldman Sachs report estimates that the adoption of self-driving cars in the United States may translate in the loss of 25 thousangs jobs per month when autonomous vehicle saturation will peak. The full effects of self-driving cars will be delayed by regulation and slow adoption. However, on February 16 also Mady Delvaux (S&D, LU) noticed that there might be negative consequences of the adoption of autonomous vehicles on the European Union job market.\n3. The different levels of automation and their development\nThe Society fo Automotive Eingineers (SAE) defines six levels of automation for driving systems:\n- Level 0: The human drivers contols completely the vehicle. An example is the park disance control.\n- Level 1: most functions are still controlled by the driver, but a specific function (accellerating or steering) can be automatic. An example is the park assist system.\n- Level 2: the driver is disengaged from physically operationg the vehicle by having his or her hands off the wheel and foot off the pedal at the same time. Examples are the cruise control system or the lane-centering and the more advanced traffic jam assist.\n- Level 3: drivers are needed, but safety-critical functions may be completely shifted to the vehicle under certain traffic or environmental conditions. An example cited by ERTRAC is the Traffic Jam Chaffeur. \n- Level 4: the vehicle is fully autonomous. A system under deployment (ERTRAC estimated its release in four years) at this level of authonom is the Highway Pilot.\n- Level 5: the system is fully autonomous and its performance is expected to equal that of a human driver in every driving scenario. The deployment of this vehicle is estimated only in ten years.\n4. Regulatory and legal frameworks, state of play\nRoad traffic is regulated by the Vienna Convention of 1968. Amost all EU Member States (with the exception of Spain) ratified the convention, that established standard traffic rules among contracting parties to facilitate road traffic and increase road safety. The Convention was amended last year, and it maintains the fundamental principle that a vehicle needs a driver. However, hthe amended Convention allows that the driver might be not always fully in control of the vehicle. Even with a highly automate system however, the driver must be present and ready at all times to regain the control of the vehicle. A further amendement is needed to permit driverless vehicles. System with high and full automation are mostly incopatibel with the Vinenna Convention.\nTechnical requirements for vehicles are internationally harmonised in the 1958 and 1998 UNECE Agreements, of which the EU is a contracting party. Under the European vehicle type approval syste, new vehicle types need a Certificate of Conformity, as stipulated by EU legislation. Also motor vehicles and their trailers must be approves according to a Framework Directive.\nThe regulatory environment relating to cyber secutrity, data privacy and liability issues is particularly important.  Uncotnrolled or unrestricted access to vehicle data in the on-board network by third parties may jeopardise the safety of the vehicle, its occupants and other road users. The new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regard to digital technologies valid across the EU. However, a dembate regarding data privacy and cnnected automatic vehicles and safety is evolving with thenew technologies.\nIn the EU product liability is harmonized by the Directive on liability for defective products. However, there is currently no framework in place harmonizing the rules on laibility  (of the holde or the driver) for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved, it differs between Member States. From a certain level of automation it might be difficult to establish causality for determining the liability of the owner or the driver. An adaptation of liability law to the new technologies and a European harmonization of the regimes concering the liability of owners and drivers of automated vehicles is necessary. \nNeed of adapting of driving education and licensing.\nPrerequisite to infrastructural investments will be to create an agreement on what coomunication is needed between vehicles (V2V) and between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I). Technical standardization will be needed.\n \n5. Ongoing work in the EU\nOn February 16 a EU parliament resolution said that EU-wide rules are needed for the fast-evolving field of robotics. In particular, MEPs referred to the need of enforcing ethical standards and establish liability rules for accidents involving driverless cars.\nThe Parliament asked to the Commission to propose rules on robotics and Artifical intelligence.\nDraft legislation is urgently needed to clarify liability issues for self-driving cars. A possible regulation may be a mandatory insurance scheme and a suppliementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driverless cars are fully conpensated.\nMEPS asked the Commission to consider creating a European agency for ronotics and artificail intelligence, to develop technical ethical and regulatory expertise on the subject. \nThe resolution passed, and the Commission will need to state its reasons if it refuses to follow the Parlaiment's recommendations.\nOn April 6 the European Commission promised dedicated funding, regulatory changes, cross-border agreeements ad innovation stimulus regarding the development of automated vehicles. Officials said that driverless trucks could be a reality in the EU in two years.\nOn May 31 the Commission published its transfort strategy, that could see driverless cars integrated with traffic within the next 10 years.\nThe strategy will start with trucks\n6.Conclusion\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 6.0\n\n"}

INTRODUCTION |  | Automated vehicle technologies allow the transfer of driving functions from a human driver to a computer. Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility. As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure. Vehicle automation also has the potential to be more environmentally friendly, efficient and accessible. |  | 2. POTENTIAL AND CHALLENGES OF VEHICLE AUTOMATION |  | Few people seem to fully grasp the profound improvement in our lives that driverless cars will bring: |  | According to the European Commission, automated driving will increase road safety significantly, as human error is involved in more than 90% of all traffic accidents on Europe's roads.  | Self-driving cars will remove a lot of vehicles from city streets because self-driving cars won\u2019t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers. | Because fewer shared vehicles will be necessary to provide the same service that personally owned vehicles provide there will be a substantial reduction in the cost of car ownership. | With no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient.  | Self-driving cars will also benefit other groups who currently cannot drive an individual car; children, elderly people or people with a disability. |  | However, the deployment of automated vehicles raises many questions around ethical, legal, financial, economic and technical implications: |  | Established rules for this technology have not yet been put in place, in particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed and it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom.   | In case of malfunction of an automated vehicle it is not clear as to who is liable when such malfunctions result in an accident: the manufacturer, the owner or the driver. | The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of traffic rules, driving education and licensing. | The growing use of vehicle automation also raises ethical issues, for example with privacy and safety.  | There will be a tremendous impact on the workforce, not only by taking away jobs from drivers but also by requiring different qualifications and skill sets of workers in the car industry. | The transition period during which human-driven cars and automated cars will be sharing the roads will extend over several decades. |  | 3. DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTOMATION AND THEIR DEPLOYMENT |  | For an effective communication between the technological and political spheres, categorisation and terminology are being developed which define different levels of vehicle automation. |  | Currently, different ways of categorising the levels of automation exist in parallel, but many organisations follow the classification set by the International Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE): |  | Level 0: Park Distance Control - The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals. | Level 1: Park Assist - The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces.  | Level 2: Traffic Jam Assist - The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h).  | Level 3: Traffic Jam Chauffeur - Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads.  | Level 4: Highway Pilot - Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. | Level 5: Fully automated vehicle - The vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger.  |  | As of today, levels 0 to 3 are already deployed on our roads, level 4 will become available over the next few years and for level 5 only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10. |  | 4. REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS - STATE OF PLAY |  | The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968 ('Vienna Convention of 1968') is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety by establishing standard traffic rules among the contracting parties. All EU Member States are signatories of the Vienna Convention \u2013 only the UK and Spain have not endorsed it.  |  | One of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. It is a very long and slow process to change treaties on the UN level, therefore the EU might take the lead in updating legislation and the UN can follow later.  |  | 5. ONGOING WORK IN THE EU |  | The European Union and its Member States participate in international working groups which are revising the regulations as prerequisites for the deployment of automated vehicles. Technical requirements for vehicles are internationally harmonised in the framework of the two following UNECE Agreements: |  | The 1958 Agreement provides the framework for establishing international UN Regulations with uniform performance\u2014oriented test provisions and administrative procedures for granting type approvals, for the conformity of production and for the mutual recognition of the type approvals granted.  | The 1998 Agreement concerns the establishing of global technical regulations for the construction of new vehicles, including performance requirements. Its purpose is to further enhance the process of international harmonisation through the development of global technical regulations (GTR).  |  | The common legal framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers is provided by a Framework Directive. Within the EU, mass-produced cars may only be used on public roads if they are type-approved in compliance with the administrative procedures and technical requirements established by the Directive. |  | The regulatory environment relating to cyber security and data privacy is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles. The new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regards to digital technologies - including vehicle automation, valid across the EU. |  | In the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products. However, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved \u2014 the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States. |  | Furthermore, the European Union is funding research on automated road transport as a priority in the Horizon 2020 Transport Research programme.  |  |  | 6. CONCLUSION |  | Road traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness in the ever-globalising world. |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n16 November 20XX\nDear Elon,\nPlease find below the briefing concerning driverless cars for this week Unit meeting. Here are summarized potentials and challenges of vehicle automation, the different levels of automation and their deployment. I have also made an overview of current regulatory and legal frameworks, and the ongoing work in the EU.\n \nDigitalisation of driving is the future of mobility. Automated vehicle could make road transport safer and more secure. Driving automation technologies would be more eco-friendly, efficient and accessible. Thus it requires adequate regulations and legal framework to overcome challenges for an efficient use of the technologies.\n1.POTENTIALS AND CHALLENGES OF VEHICLE AUTOMATION\nVehicle automation is the key future in transport development. Many benefits could result in implementing driving digitalisation while some challenges and questions still need to be addressed. \nPOTENTIALS\nUsing driverles cars is first money saving. It could remove to one-half of all vehicles from the streets allowing 70 % cost reduction of car ownership via shared automated vehicles.Less infrastructures buildings will be needed, that reduces expenses linked to traffic equipments (signage, traffic lights etc.).\nThis could lead to social benefits at it could ease acces to transport for specific groups of people: disable person, women or person living outside cities could have on-demand personal transportation. \nRoads will become safer as the number of streets accidents should drop due to traffic reduction. \nDiscrimation against individuals ( police intervention in traffic violations) and insurance discrimination could be impacted positively.\nThe use of driverless will also be eco-friendly as traffic will be reduced due to more automated car sharing offer and there will be more energy saving with no more use of public lights for instance. The resulting changes in car equipments and design will make vehicles lighter and more fuel-efficient e.g. no more brake pedals or steering wheels.\nCHALLENGES\nThere are unresolved issues related to ethics i.e human dignity respect, privacy and safety worries like the control of the vehicle in emergency case.\nAnother concern is the lack of regulation or rules to clarify liabilty matters for accidents involving driverless car. There is an absense of EU-wide rules and technical standards in these subjects.\nPeople also worry about potential negative impact on the labour market:  loss of certain jobs due to automation e.g. for professional drivers.\nThere are still questions on cyber security risks and data protection issues related to connected automated vehicle.\n2. THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTOMATION AND THEIR DEPLOYMENT\nIt is important to clarify the meaning of \"autonomous driving\". The NHTSA defined the five levels of autonomy describing the IT system in vehicles. They are:\nLevel 0: fully control by human.This is already deployed e.g. Park Distance Control.\nLevel 1: a specific function are done automatically by the car. This is already deployed e.g. Park Assist.\nLevel 2: at least one driver assistance system is automated. This is already deployed e.g. Traffic Jam Assist.\nLevel 3: safety-critical functions can be completly shifted to the vehicle (under certain traffic and environmental conditions). This is already deployed e.g. Traffic Jam Chauffeur.\nLevel 4: \"fully autonomous\" i.e. vehicles are designed to perform all safety critical driving functions and monitor roadway condition for an entire trip. This does not cover all driving scenario. This is could be deployed by 20XX+4 e.g. Higway Pilot.\nLevel 5: fully-autonomous system i.e. vehicles' performance ishould equal that of a human driver in every driving scenario. This is could be deployed by 20XX+10 e.g. \"The fully automated vehicle\".\n3. REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK, STATE OF PLAY\nTo answer challenges related to the use of automated vehicles, the European Commission already set in place a number of regulations.\nThe Vienna convention on Road Traffic of 1968 signed by all members states (in exception of Spain, an international treaty, establishes standard traffic rules among the contracting parties. But the convention and its amendment still demand that all vehicle must have a driver to take over the driving control in emergency cases. Thus high or full automation of vehicle are incompatibe with the Vienna convention.\nThe EU is a contracting party to the 1958 and the 1998 UNECE Agreements providing international harmonised framework in technical requirements for vehicles. The 1958 agreement, the EU vehicle type approval system granted by a national authority provides a Certificate of Conformity respecting legal requirements stipulated by the EU legislation.The Framework Directive of the 1998 Agreement establishes procedures and technical requirements for cars to be used on public roads.\nThe New General Data Protection Regulation establishes set of rules on data protection across the EU to ensure unauthorised disclosure and manipulation of automated vehicle data.\nWithin the EU there is no common harmonised rules on liabilty for damages caused by accidents involving motor vehicle. An adaption of liabilty law and a European harmonisation of the regimes concerning the liabilty of owners and/or drivers of automated vehicles is necessary.\n4.ONGOING WORK IN THE EU\nThe commission is still working on main issues related to automated vehicle in the EU. The legal framework for road safety has to be adapted. There is also a need to redefine infrastructure and technical standards. Reflection on questions concerning data processing and liabilty are as well underway.\nOn 16 February, MEPs proposed to the commision a code of Ethical conduct to ensure legal and ethical standards application and human dignity respect. MEPS stressed the need to draft legislation concerning liabiliites issues for selfdriving cars and to follow closely the impact of robots development on the labor market. It also suggests the creation of a European agency for robotics and artificial intelligence to supply public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise.\nDriverless cars integrated with traffic by 20XX+10 is part of the Commission transport strategy. Trucks are expected to go first driverless in motorways. As part of an experiment semi-autonomous platoons of trucks from around Europe started travelling to Rotterdam in early April.\n \nMany advantages can be considered in vehicle automation as the key future in transport development. Lot of  benefits can result in implementing driving digitalisation like money and energy saving or improvement in transportation availabilty. However some challenges and questions still need to be addressed.The commission is still working on main issues related to automated vehicle in the EU: The legal framework and standards. Reflection on questions concerning data processing and liabilty are also underway.\n \nI hope this will be usefull and clear for the colleagues.\nPlease get back to me if you have comments or think that further information should be added.\nThank you.\nRegards,\nXXX\nEconomist officer - DG mobility and transport\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 7.5\n\n"}

The framework establishes three categories of UA operations with different safety requirements based on the level of risk involved. The \"open\" category is for low-risk operations that do not require prior authorization, the \"specific\" category is for medium-risk operations that require authorization based on an operational risk assessment, and the \"certified\" category is for high-risk operations that require certification of the UA, licensed remote pilot, and approved operator. The proposal also addresses technical and operational requirements for drones, including remote identification, geofencing, and pilots' qualifications.\n\nHeadline: Cyber Security Expert Warns of Drone-Jacking Risks\n\nSummary: A cyber security expert warns of the risks associated with drone-jacking, which refers to the hacking or physical misuse of drones. The expert highlights the potential for drones to be hacked and used for illegal purposes or to steal sensitive data. The loss of data via drone-jacking could lead to privacy concerns and potential fines under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. The expert recommends the implementation of targeted legislation and effective insurance policies to cover the risks associated with drone technology.\n\nHeadline: Near-Misses Between Drones and Planes Highlight Need for EU Laws\n\nSummary: The European Commission calls for EU-wide regulation of drones following a series of near-misses with airplanes across Europe. The commission reports over 1,200 \"safety occurrences\" involving drones in Europe, including incidents involving planes. The commission emphasizes the need for swift action to prevent potentially disastrous consequences. The commission drafts laws for EU-wide regulation, which must be agreed upon by the European Parliament and national governments before entering into force.\n\nHeadline: North Wales Police Utilize Drones for Crime-Fighting\n\nSummary: North Wales Police has trained officers and staff to use drones for crime-fighting purposes. The drones are used to capture video and images for investigations, including searching for missing people and gathering evidence from road traffic incidents and major crimes. The drones have proven effective in gathering information quickly and safely, especially in difficult terrain or hard-to-reach areas. The live images captured by the drones can be viewed by police on the ground and have been used to assist firefighters in tackling a large blaze. The drones are seen as a cost-effective tool in fighting crime and helping communities.\n\nHeadline: Drone Makers Focus on Commercial Opportunities\n\nSummary: Drone makers are exploring new commercial opportunities beyond consumer use. Drones are being used for various purposes, such as delivering packages, surveying mines, firefighting, and collecting data for conservation efforts. The industry is adapting to new market dynamics, with industrial and tech groups showing interest in the sector. Regulators are also preparing for change, with the US Federal Aviation Administration opening the skies to commercial drones and providing more certain regulatory guidelines. Drone makers are looking into areas such as agriculture and mosquito elimination to expand their market presence. While consumer drones still dominate the market, the industry is expected to see continued growth in both consumer and commercial sectors.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the Case Study. \n\nBrussels, 16th of June 20XX |  | INTERNAL MEMO |  | From: <your name> | To: Press Office | Subject: U-Space Blueprint |  | Dear colleagues, |  | You are kindly requested to prepare a press release based on the following information. |  | BLUEPRINT FOR DRONE USE IN LOW-LEVEL AIRSPACE UNVEILED TODAY |  | Following a request by the European Commission, the Single European Sky Air traffic management Research Joint Undertaking (SESAR) has today unveiled its blueprint to make drone use in low-level airspace safe, secure and environmentally friendly. |  | The Blueprint is part of the Commission's drive to deliver on its ambitious Aviation Strategy and unleash the full economic potential of drones by 20XX+2. This requires an effective legislative framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of legitimate concerns, the first of which is safety. |  | The blueprint outlines the proposed vision for U-space and how it could be rolled out. Rather than providing a definitive solution, this blueprint provides the basis to better define the way drones will operate in Europe in the future.   |  |  | OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS OF UNMANNED OR REMOTELY PILOTED VEHICLES IN THE EUROPEAN AIRSPACE |  | Drones have been used to shoot weddings, Hollywood movies and terrorists. But now drones are navigating a third path between hobbyists and warfare into the industrial world.  |  | New uses for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging almost daily: delivering packages, pizzas and blood; surveying mines; pre-emptive firefighting; and crime investigations.  |  | According to Gerald Van Hoy, senior research analyst at Gartner, 3 million drones are expected to be shipped this year, and this should translate into revenues of $6 Billion. However, drones pose an array of threats, and reports of drone-related accidents and near-misses are on the rise. Moreover, we can no longer rely on fences or barriers around our homes to protect our privacy and drones without adequate security in place will be vulnerable to hacks, as well as physical attacks.  |  | Theft of data is another real risk, particularly if the drone contains personal or sensitive information, whether this is customer data included for delivery purposes or footage collected via an attached camera.  |  | Accident liability and insurance related legislation is yet to be developed and public acceptance is key to the development of the industry. |  | U-SPACE \u2013 A BLUEPRINT FOR DRONE USE IN LOW-LEVEL AIRSPACE |  | U-space is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for large numbers of drones.  |  | These services rely on a high level of digitalisation and automation of functions, whether they are on board the drone itself or part of the ground-based environment.  |  | U-space provides an enabling framework to support routine drone operations, as well as a clear and effective interface to manned aviation. |  | The delivery of U-space relies upon the following key principles: | To ensure the safety of all airspace users operating in the U-space framework, as well as people on the ground. | To provide a scalable, flexible and adaptable system that can respond to changes in demand, volume, technology, business models and applications, while managing the interface with manned aviation. | To enable high-density operations with multiple automated drones under the supervision of fleet operators. | To guarantee equitable and fair access to airspace for all users. | To enable competitive and cost-effective service provision at all times, supporting the business models of drone operators. | To minimise deployment and operating costs by leveraging as much of the existing aeronautical services and infrastructure as possible, including GNSS as well as those from other sectors, such as mobile communication services. | To accelerate deployment by adopting technologies and standards from other sectors where they meet the needs of U-space. | To follow a risk-based and performance-driven approach when setting up appropriate requirements for safety, security and resilience, while minimising environmental impact and respecting the privacy of citizens, including data protection. |  | Subject to compliance with applicable regulations, operational limitations and technical requirements linked to the operation of the drone, U-space facilitates any kind of mission, from the delivery of goods, aerial work, and search and rescue, to more complex future applications such as urban air mobility. |  | U-space services are offered to both private and public users of drones, for all types of missions.  |  | In addition, the criticality of these services will lead to the establishment of performance requirements for both structural elements and service delivery, covering, for example, safety, security, availability, continuity and resilience. |  | NEXT STEPS |  | The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules that are proportionate to the risk of the operation.  | These rules will implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which the European Parliament and the Council (i.e. the EU Member States) are expected to adopt in the coming months. |  | The Commission, through the SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system. |  | CONCLUSIONS |  | The U-space framework comprises an extensive and scalable range of services relying on agreed EU standards and delivered by service providers.  |  | These services do not look to replicate the function of air traffic control. However, they do deliver key services to organise the safe and efficient operation of drones, ensuring a proper interface with manned aviation, ATC and relevant authorities.  |  |  |  | (signed) | <your name> | DG Mobility and Transport |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n \nThe Commission drive to deliver on its ambitious Aviation Strategy to promote the economic potential of drones by 20xx+2 by promoting a legislative framework to encourage leadership and competitiveness and in the same time to address several concerns like safety issues.\nSESAR published its blueprint to make drone use in low lever airspace safe, secure and environmental friendly:  Following main principles were outlined:\nSafety: similar concept developed like the Air Traffic Management for named aviation\nAutomated: the system will provide information for automated and autonomous drones to fly safely and avoid collisions\nUp and running by 20xx-2 for basic services like registration, e-identification and geo-fencing.

Commission VP for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton met with representatives of these organizations to discuss the issue. Jourov\u00e1 will present her initiative at a press point, emphasizing the importance of fighting disinformation in the context of defending democracy and EU values.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: The Most Pressing Dangers of AI\n\nSummary: AI systems pose various risks and dangers that need to be addressed. These include techno-solutionism, which views AI as a panacea and can lead to larger problems; the adoption of a statistical perspective on justice, which can result in biased outcomes; the potential for disinformation and threats to democracy through AI manipulation; discrimination and risk in the medical setting; and the risks associated with generative AI, such as deepfakes and the spread of misinformation. The European Commission is proposing a regulatory framework on AI to address these risks and ensure the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses. Additionally, the EU is pushing for AI labels to identify AI-generated content and fight against deepfakes and disinformation.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \nPress point by Commission VP Jourova on generative AI\n10th of June 20XX at 11:15 \u2013 Charlemagne building (Room TBD) \n(INTRODUCTION)\nGood morning.\nWe are living in a Brave New World.\nGenerative AI is making breathtaking advances \u2014 from writing texts to creating ever more realistic pictures and videos.\nOver these last months we have been baffled by the exploits of ChatGTP and DALL.E, to the point that many of us in this room are fearing for their job in a not-so-distant future.\nBut there is more: generative AI will have enormous consequences not just for the future of our work, but for society, politics, and democracy. \nYesterday, Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton and myself have met representatives of 40-odd companies and organizations that have signed up to the EU\u2019s Code of Practice against disinformation. \nWe have asked them to come up with a clear labelling system to identify AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation. \nThe Commission wants to prevent artificial intelligence from blurring the lines between fact and fiction.\nToday, I would like to put this initiative in its wider context for you.\n(PAUSE)\n(WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI)\nNow, what exactly is generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence.\nGenerative AI generates outputs that appear authentic and human-like: text, images, graphics, music, etc.\nGenerative AI algorithms learn from training data that include examples of the desired output. \nBased on the patterns and structures within the training data, generative AI models can produce new content that shares characteristics with the original input data. \nThe most compelling advantage generative AI proposes is that it enables businesses to automate specific tasks and focus time, energy, and resources on more important strategic objectives:\nFor example, in content creation, generative AI can produce text, images and even music, assisting marketers, journalists, and artists with their creative processes. \nIn customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can provide more personalized assistance and reduce response times.\nGenerative AI is used in medicine to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs, saving time and money in research. \n\n(PAUSE)\n\n(THE DANGERS OF GENERATIVE AI)\nHowever, generative AI presents numerous issues requiring attention. \nOne major concern is its potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThe technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage. \nDisinformation poses serious threats to society, as it effectively changes and manipulates evidence to create social feedback loops that undermine any sense of objective truth. \nAI systems used to spread disinformation on the internet, can become a threat to society, politics, and democracy. \n(PAUSE)\n\n(LEGAL FRAMEWORK ON AI)\nSome two years ago, the European Commission began drafting the first-ever legal framework on AI, addressing the risks of AI and positioning Europe to play a leading role globally. \nA couple of weeks ago, this new Legal Framework on AI entered the co-decision stage. \nUnder the proposals, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level: from minimal through to limited, high, and unacceptable. \nWhile high-risk tools will not be banned, those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations.\nClearly, many generative AI systems belong in the high-risk category.\n(PAUSE)\n(NEW RULES FOR GENERATIVE AI)\nLast April, the European Union proposed new copyright rules for generative AI.\nCompanies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney, will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems.\nSome committee members initially proposed banning copyrighted material being used to train generative AI models altogether, but this was abandoned in favour of a transparency requirement.\nClear Labels. Services with a potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation should put in place technology to recognize such content and clearly label this to users. \nThe label should apply to all AI-generated material that can be used to create disinformation, including text, images, audio, and video.\nOn the other hand, services that integrate generative AI like Bingchat for Microsoft, Bard for Google should build in necessary safeguards that these services cannot be used by malicious actors to generate disinformation.\nFor now, labelling wouldn\u2019t be mandatory, given that it would be part of the voluntary Code of Practice. \nHowever, the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act (DSA). \nObligations on labeling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament, and the Commission.\n(CONCLUSION)\nAllow me to conclude this brief presentation now.\nGenerative AI has the potential for spreading disinformation or malicious content.\nThis poses a threat to our democratic society.\nThe EU is on the frontier of regulating AI technology and is now moving ahead to regulate generative AI.\n(PAUSE)\nI am now ready to answer your questions.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nSpeaking Note for the Commissioner on Generative Al (GAI):\nDate: 9 June 20XX\nIntroduction\nGood morning everyone,\nToday I would like to talk about a topic that\u00b4s both exciting and challenging: Generative Al, or GAI. As the world of technology continues to evolve at an exponential rate, it\u00b4s crucial that we, as the European Commission, are proactive in understanding and addressing the challenges posed by these advancements.\n1. Understanding Generative AI (AL)\nGenerative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that has capability to generate text, images, or other media in response to prompts. By learning the patterns and structures of input data, these AI models can produce new content that shares similar characteristics.\nPotential Benefits:\n- Innovation: GAI can stimulate creativity by producing unique content, aiding fields like art music, and literature.\n- Efficiency: It can generate vast amounts of data quickly, supporting industries like medicine, finance and entertainment \n- Personalization: GAI can be used tom tailor content to individual needs, enhancinguser experiences across digital platforms.\n2. The Flip Side: Dangers Associated with GAI:\nAs with all technologies, GAI isn\u00b4t without its risk.Some of the challenges include:\n- Disinformation: Generative AI can create convincing fake news, deepfakes or fabricated evidence which can distort truth and mislead public.\n- Econmic Risks: Over-reliance can lead to loss of jobs, especially in sectors reliant on content creation.\n-Ethical Concerns: GAI might be used to imperonate individuals, potentially damaging reputations or violating privacy rights\n3. The EU\u00b4s Stance:\nThe European Union recognises the duality of GAI - its potential benefits and its possible dangers. We believe in harnessing the power of GAI, but in a way that is safe, ethical, and beneficial for all.\nHow the EU plans to Address GAI\u00b4s Challenges:\n- Regulation: We are considering regulations that ensure reponsibilities and transparent use of GAI, especially in sectors like media and public communications.\n- Education: It is crucial to educate public about GAI-generated content, allowing individuals to discern between authentic and Al-generated content.\n- Collaboration: We intend to work closely with the tech companies to ensure they adopt ethical practices when deploying GAI technologies. Today\u00b4s push for an \u00b4AI lebel`s` is a testament to our commitment.\n- Promoting Transparency: Encouraging tech companies to develop tools that can detect and label AI - generated content, helping users to make informed decisions.\n- Protection: The EU aims to safeguard individuals from malicious users of GAI, ensuring the protection of personal data and preventing identity theft.\nConclusion:\nGenerative AI is a testament to human ingenuity but it\u00b4s our collective responsibility to ensure that it\u00b4s used judiciously. The European Commission is committed to leading the way, fostering an environment where GAI can thrive without compromising our share values.\nThank you\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 8.0\n\n"}

INTRODUCTION |  | Automated vehicle technologies allow the transfer of driving functions from a human driver to a computer. Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility. As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure. Vehicle automation also has the potential to be more environmentally friendly, efficient and accessible. |  | 2. POTENTIAL AND CHALLENGES OF VEHICLE AUTOMATION |  | Few people seem to fully grasp the profound improvement in our lives that driverless cars will bring: |  | According to the European Commission, automated driving will increase road safety significantly, as human error is involved in more than 90% of all traffic accidents on Europe's roads.  | Self-driving cars will remove a lot of vehicles from city streets because self-driving cars won\u2019t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers. | Because fewer shared vehicles will be necessary to provide the same service that personally owned vehicles provide there will be a substantial reduction in the cost of car ownership. | With no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient.  | Self-driving cars will also benefit other groups who currently cannot drive an individual car; children, elderly people or people with a disability. |  | However, the deployment of automated vehicles raises many questions around ethical, legal, financial, economic and technical implications: |  | Established rules for this technology have not yet been put in place, in particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed and it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom.   | In case of malfunction of an automated vehicle it is not clear as to who is liable when such malfunctions result in an accident: the manufacturer, the owner or the driver. | The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of traffic rules, driving education and licensing. | The growing use of vehicle automation also raises ethical issues, for example with privacy and safety.  | There will be a tremendous impact on the workforce, not only by taking away jobs from drivers but also by requiring different qualifications and skill sets of workers in the car industry. | The transition period during which human-driven cars and automated cars will be sharing the roads will extend over several decades. |  | 3. DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTOMATION AND THEIR DEPLOYMENT |  | For an effective communication between the technological and political spheres, categorisation and terminology are being developed which define different levels of vehicle automation. |  | Currently, different ways of categorising the levels of automation exist in parallel, but many organisations follow the classification set by the International Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE): |  | Level 0: Park Distance Control - The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals. | Level 1: Park Assist - The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces.  | Level 2: Traffic Jam Assist - The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h).  | Level 3: Traffic Jam Chauffeur - Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads.  | Level 4: Highway Pilot - Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. | Level 5: Fully automated vehicle - The vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger.  |  | As of today, levels 0 to 3 are already deployed on our roads, level 4 will become available over the next few years and for level 5 only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10. |  | 4. REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS - STATE OF PLAY |  | The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968 ('Vienna Convention of 1968') is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety by establishing standard traffic rules among the contracting parties. All EU Member States are signatories of the Vienna Convention \u2013 only the UK and Spain have not endorsed it.  |  | One of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. It is a very long and slow process to change treaties on the UN level, therefore the EU might take the lead in updating legislation and the UN can follow later.  |  | 5. ONGOING WORK IN THE EU |  | The European Union and its Member States participate in international working groups which are revising the regulations as prerequisites for the deployment of automated vehicles. Technical requirements for vehicles are internationally harmonised in the framework of the two following UNECE Agreements: |  | The 1958 Agreement provides the framework for establishing international UN Regulations with uniform performance\u2014oriented test provisions and administrative procedures for granting type approvals, for the conformity of production and for the mutual recognition of the type approvals granted.  | The 1998 Agreement concerns the establishing of global technical regulations for the construction of new vehicles, including performance requirements. Its purpose is to further enhance the process of international harmonisation through the development of global technical regulations (GTR).  |  | The common legal framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers is provided by a Framework Directive. Within the EU, mass-produced cars may only be used on public roads if they are type-approved in compliance with the administrative procedures and technical requirements established by the Directive. |  | The regulatory environment relating to cyber security and data privacy is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles. The new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regards to digital technologies - including vehicle automation, valid across the EU. |  | In the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products. However, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved \u2014 the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States. |  | Furthermore, the European Union is funding research on automated road transport as a priority in the Horizon 2020 Transport Research programme.  |  |  | 6. CONCLUSION |  | Road traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness in the ever-globalising world. |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nIntroduction\nThe deployment of driverless cars comes with potentials and challenges. The European Parliament calls for EU-wide rules for the field of robotics. Regulation on road traffic, technical requirements, liabililty and data protection, are on the spotlight, in the context of this deployment. \nPotentials and Challenges of vehicle automation\nOn one hand, KPMG claims that the number of accidents will go down by 80% within the upcoming 19 years. However, it is not clear if the driverless cars is the only factor leading to this development. The Earth Institute at Columbia University projects 70% reduction in the car ownership costs becasue fewer shared vehicles will be necessary to provide the same collective services that personally owned vehicles provide. The executive director of the Santa Clara Valley Blind Center appears to suport the use of driverless cars too.\nOn the other hand, regarding the impact to the labour market, iGoldman Sachs argues that 25,000 jobs per month will be lost in the USA, due to autonomous vehicles, but many different employment and productivity measures do not show massive disruption from labor-palcing techologies. An other issue arising about the depolyment of autonomous cars concerns data protection and potential breaches. \nThe different levels of automation and their deployment \nBased on the European Road Transport Research Advisory Council, park distance control, park assist, traffic jum assist and chauffeur (i.e. Levels 0-3) have already been depolyed. Highghaw Pilot and fully automated vehicles (i.e. Levels 4-5) are to be depoyed in 4 years and (potentially) 10 years respectively. \nRegulatory and legal frameworks, state of play\nThe deployment of driverless cars needs the update and allignement of rules and regulations regarding liability, data protection, road traffic, and technical requirements. Regarding road traffic regulations, the Vienna Convention demands that every vehicle must have a driver, which could hinder the deployment of automated vehicles. As concerns the technical requirements, the EU is a contracting party to the 1958 and 1998 United Nations Economic Commision for Europe agreements that harmonize the requirements for vehicles internationally' Concerning data protection, the new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regard to digital technologies, valid across the EU. Regarding liability, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which vehicles are involved, while the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the EU member states.\nOngoing work in the EU\nFirstlly, the EU Parliament has resovled on the enforcement of EU-wide rules for the field of robotics. At this direction, it has asked the EU Commission to propose rules on robotics and artificial intelligence to guarantee standard level of safety and security, to create a specific legal status for robots in order to establish who is liable if they casue damage, and to consider creating a European agency for robots and artificial intelligence to supply public authorities with technical, ethical, and regulatory expertise. Moreover, accroding to a press article of Euractiv, officials have said that driveless trucks could be a reality in European motorways within two years. Forthermore, during the EU's 60th anniversary summit in Rome, national leader signed an agreement to allow cross-boarder tests and experiments and to establish a single point of contact in each country to approve them.\n", "completion": "Overall Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}
