They emphasize the need for strict quality standards and proper implementation to prevent the emergence of resistant bacteria. They suggest that livestock density needs to be reduced to ensure safe food production and avoid antibiotics resistance.\n\nHeadline: Impact assessment report on revised animal welfare regulation\n\nSummary: The impact assessment report on the revised animal welfare regulation has been released. The report assesses the impacts of various policy measures, including the phasing out of confining cages for pigs, calves, laying hens, rabbits, and fur-producing animals, the banning of the killing of day-old male chicks, the banning of painful mutilations, and animal welfare requirements at import. The report considers cost-efficiency, environmental and societal impacts, and impacts on the single market. It also highlights the need for a balanced and economically viable transition to cage-free farming and suggests measures such as economic incentives and awareness campaigns.\n\nHeadline: Commissioner Kyriakides meets with \"End the Cage Age\" representatives\n\nSummary: Commissioner Stella Kyriakides, in charge of EU animal welfare legislation, has met with representatives of the \"End the Cage Age\" citizens' initiative. She expressed her support for investigating the initiative and finding ways to improve animal welfare. She emphasized the need for a balanced approach that takes into account the interests of farmers and considers economic, social, health, and environmental impacts. She assured that industry interests will not dominate the decision-making process and that the strong message from European citizens regarding animal rights and welfare will be respected.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \n\nIntroduction and background\nThis briefing note summarises the main remaining issues in the preparation of our draft proposal for the revised animal welfare regulation. Following the impact assessment concluded last year, a legislative proposal has been prepared and the inter-service consultation was recently concluded. We received positive opinions except for one negative opinion from DG AGRI, setting a condition regarding the preferred option for banning cages for laying hens.\n\nMain issues\nThe legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: \nrestricting the use of cages/crates;\nending the killing of day-old male chickens;\nbanning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and\nsetting animal welfare requirements at import.\n\nThe legislative proposal is based on the medium or high ambition option for all these measures. The cost-benefit analysis from the impact assessment showed that this would be the most efficient way forward. It is also in line with the outcomes of our stakeholder consultations and pressure from citizens. \n\nOther DGs support our draft proposal except when it comes to the ban on cages for laying hens. DG AGRI are concerned about the risk of unfair competition and raised food prices as a result of a cage ban. They therefore issued a negative opinion in the inter-service consultation. DG AGRI wants to see the low-ambition option (phase-in of a cage ban over 12 years) or even no legislative change at all, whereas the DG SANTE preferred option is the high-ambition option with phase-in over 5 years and no exceptions made. We would also like to see the ban combined with space requirements to ensure that free-range hens have sufficient living area. Sufficient space per animal is also needed for health and safety reasons including to minimise the risk of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nIt is true that this high-ambition option would have an impact on food pricing, though our impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. The main limitation is that poultry farmers will be able to house fewer birds per square meter. To some extent, farmers could be compensated for this via the Common Agricultural Policy or other economic incentives.\n\nFor small farmers, this seems not to be a main issue, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. In several Member States, the cage ban will also make no difference as they already adopted a ban within their national legislation. For internal market purposes, a cage ban would therefore help create a more level playing field.\n\nA more important problem is the competition with imported goods from third countries. This seems to be the real core concern of DG AGRI. Among our proposed options, we did propose to require stricter animal welfare rules also for imported animals and animal products, though our impact assessment implied that the medium ambition option would be the most cost-efficient choice.\n\nOptions for the way forward\nThere seems to be two main options for the way forward: compromise on the cage ban or compromise on the import rules.\n\nA compromise on the cage ban for laying hens would mean abandonning our preferred option to settle at the low or medium options instead. This would still be an improvement compared to the current situation. However, it is likely that the Commission would then be heavily criticised by NGOs as well as by the European Parliament who called for a total ban in shorter time. \n\nThe other possibility would be to focus instead on the real underlying problem raised by DG AGRI: the risk of unfair competition from third countries. DG AGRI have indicated that the transition time and exceptions for small farms are not the real problem, so a compromise solution on the cage ban proposal is not necessarily in their best interest. We could instead try to convince them to change their current position and accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages, in exchange for instead increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).\n\nThis would however require another round of talks also with DG TRADE who gave a positive opinion in the inter-service consultation. We have no information about their willingness to agree to such a compromise.\n\nConclusion\nOur recommendation is to, as a first priority, seek a compromise with DG AGRI based on stricter import rules. This would address their main concern while not compromising our preferred options or lowering the level of ambition for animal welfare.\n\nIf this fails, the fallback option could be to strike a compromise based on a longer phase-in period of the cage ban (low or medium ambition option).\n\nIf you agree to this plan of action, we can start informally consulting DG AGRI and DG TRADE immediately\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nDate: 1 June 202X\nTo: Ms Heinrich (Director General of DG SANTE)\nSubject: Animal welfare legislative proposal \nMain issues at stake (remaining problems)\n- To address the specific objective of the animal welfare legislation revision, we have 4 policy measures with different ambition options (low, medium, high): 1) Pigs 2) Calves 3) Laying hens and pullets 4) Rabbits and fur-producing animals. The general transition period: 5-12 years depending on the level of the ambition (please see the table attached)\n- For the banning of i) the killing of day-old male chicks and ii) paintful mutilations we should consider a ten years' transition period. \nReccommendations\n- we need to make sure to have similar or fully equivalent animal welfare requirements for products of animal origin imported to the EU\n- the pressure over production costs due to a competitive global market for the farmers and all food business operators led to further intensification of the killing practices, and to a replacement of small farms by very large industrial scale installations\n- we need to consider technological developments in relation to agricultural practices, zootechnics and transport operations\n- we ned to have harmonised EU rules in order to stop MSs to adopt different national measures that jeropardise the legal landscape also for animal welfare labelling.\n- the policy option to be most cost-efficient is a total prohibition on the use of cages for laying hens with a transition period of 5 years. The same requirment should be applied for eggs and egg products imported to the EU form 3rd countries.\n- as suggested by DG AGRI a compensation mechnism for farmers should be taken into consideratino to avoid the increase of the price for consumers.\n- we should take into consideration also the recommendation of the EFSA concerning the livestock density that should be reduced: free range layer birds with more interactions with each other can lead to an increased incidence of infectious poultry disease\nBackgorund information\n- After an European citizen's initiative \"End the cage Age\" and an own initiative resolution of the EUropean Parliament recommending a total ban on the use of cages in animal agriculture, the Commission is revising the Animal welfare Regulation. \n- We launched an inter-service consultation on the review of the the animal welfare Regulation, we got green light by all DGs except DG AGRI.\n", "completion": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 5.0\n\n"}

However, the adoption of driverless cars also raises challenges in terms of establishing EU-wide liability rules, adapting the legal and regulatory framework, ensuring data privacy and cyber security, and addressing liability issues in case of malfunctions.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the Case Study. \n\n1. INTRODUCTION |  | Automated vehicle technologies allow the transfer of driving functions from a human driver to a computer. Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility. As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure. Vehicle automation also has the potential to be more environmentally friendly, efficient and accessible. |  | 2. POTENTIAL AND CHALLENGES OF VEHICLE AUTOMATION |  | Few people seem to fully grasp the profound improvement in our lives that driverless cars will bring: |  | According to the European Commission, automated driving will increase road safety significantly, as human error is involved in more than 90% of all traffic accidents on Europe's roads.  | Self-driving cars will remove a lot of vehicles from city streets because self-driving cars won\u2019t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers. | Because fewer shared vehicles will be necessary to provide the same service that personally owned vehicles provide there will be a substantial reduction in the cost of car ownership. | With no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient.  | Self-driving cars will also benefit other groups who currently cannot drive an individual car; children, elderly people or people with a disability. |  | However, the deployment of automated vehicles raises many questions around ethical, legal, financial, economic and technical implications: |  | Established rules for this technology have not yet been put in place, in particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed and it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom.   | In case of malfunction of an automated vehicle it is not clear as to who is liable when such malfunctions result in an accident: the manufacturer, the owner or the driver. | The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of traffic rules, driving education and licensing. | The growing use of vehicle automation also raises ethical issues, for example with privacy and safety.  | There will be a tremendous impact on the workforce, not only by taking away jobs from drivers but also by requiring different qualifications and skill sets of workers in the car industry. | The transition period during which human-driven cars and automated cars will be sharing the roads will extend over several decades. |  | 3. DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTOMATION AND THEIR DEPLOYMENT |  | For an effective communication between the technological and political spheres, categorisation and terminology are being developed which define different levels of vehicle automation. |  | Currently, different ways of categorising the levels of automation exist in parallel, but many organisations follow the classification set by the International Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE): |  | Level 0: Park Distance Control - The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals. | Level 1: Park Assist - The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces.  | Level 2: Traffic Jam Assist - The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h).  | Level 3: Traffic Jam Chauffeur - Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads.  | Level 4: Highway Pilot - Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. | Level 5: Fully automated vehicle - The vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger.  |  | As of today, levels 0 to 3 are already deployed on our roads, level 4 will become available over the next few years and for level 5 only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10. |  | 4. REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS - STATE OF PLAY |  | The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968 ('Vienna Convention of 1968') is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety by establishing standard traffic rules among the contracting parties. All EU Member States are signatories of the Vienna Convention \u2013 only the UK and Spain have not endorsed it.  |  | One of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. It is a very long and slow process to change treaties on the UN level, therefore the EU might take the lead in updating legislation and the UN can follow later.  |  | 5. ONGOING WORK IN THE EU |  | The European Union and its Member States participate in international working groups which are revising the regulations as prerequisites for the deployment of automated vehicles. Technical requirements for vehicles are internationally harmonised in the framework of the two following UNECE Agreements: |  | The 1958 Agreement provides the framework for establishing international UN Regulations with uniform performance\u2014oriented test provisions and administrative procedures for granting type approvals, for the conformity of production and for the mutual recognition of the type approvals granted.  | The 1998 Agreement concerns the establishing of global technical regulations for the construction of new vehicles, including performance requirements. Its purpose is to further enhance the process of international harmonisation through the development of global technical regulations (GTR).  |  | The common legal framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers is provided by a Framework Directive.

Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility and will create challenges. As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure. It has also the potential to be more environmentally friendly, efficient and accessible. However, automated vehicle technologies require an effective regulatory and legislative framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of legitimate concerns.\n1. Potentials and challenges of vehicle automation\nThe potential impact of the deployment of automated vehicles has several aspects with technical, financial, economic, legal and ethical dimensions. \nDriverless cars will reform transportation as we know it by improoving our lives. Their adoption will slash accident and fatality rates, saving millions of lives. It will remove one-third to one-half of all vehicles from city streets because self-driving cars don\u2019t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers. \nEliminating human drivers will also allow automobile designers to build cars from a completely different mind set.The A.I. system driving the car will also reduce accidents to negligible levels. With no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient.\nFrom economic aspect, car sharing will cost a fraction of what car ownership today costs. Owning a car for daily, personal transportation will seem impractical while workers could gain productive hours in the day by working instead of driving during daily commutes.\nInnovations in this field are also poised to completely change the car insurance industry by reducing accidents\u2014a new report predicts that accidents will drop by 80% by 20XX+20\nAt the same time policy makers, face challenges in designing the appropriate legal and regulatory framework so that new technologies are used properly and for the benefit of society.\nThe rapid development of robots/automated cars might result in changes in the labour market through the creation, displacement and loss of certain jobs for example the replacement of corporate fleets for deliveries or transporting employees will push up the unemployment. \nLast but not least, the growing use of robotics  raises ethical issues concerning privacy and safety. The new technologies raise questions as to how data privacy and cyber security will be addressed. The highly or fully automated vehicle will process data and make decisions: this raises ethical issues which have to be solved in a societal dialogue. The programmed algorithms will make decisions in conflicting situations, such as a choice between two unavoidable crash scenarios. How will the decision be taken? What 'best driving behaviour' should be reflected by the system? A possible solution could be a voluntary ethical code of conduct on robotics for researchers and designers to ensure that they operate in accordance with legal and ethical standards and that robot design and use respect human dignity.\n2. The different levels of automation and their deployment\nBut, what does \"autonomous driving\" really mean? The US Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defined five different levels of autonomous driving.The levels are six (0-5).\nLevel 0 - Park Distance Control (already deployed): The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals.\nLevel 1 - Park Assist (already deployed): The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces. The system assists the driver by automatically carrying out the optimum steering movements in order to reverse - park on the ideal line. However, the driver has to operate the accelerator and the brake having the control of the car at all times.\nLevel 2 - Traffic Jam Assist (already deployed): The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h). The system can be seen as an extension of the Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop&Go functionality, i.e. no lane change support.\nLevel 3 - Traffic Jam Chauffeur (already deployed): Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads. The system can be activated in a traffic jam scenario. It detects a slow-driving vehicle in front and then handles the vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Later versions of this functionality might include lane change functionality.\nLevel 4 - Highway Pilot (possible deployment 20XX+4): Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver must deliberately activate the system, but does not have to monitor it constantly. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. There is no request from the system to the driver to take over when the system is in its normal operation area on the motorway. Depending on the deployment of vehicle-to-vehicle communication and cooperative systems, ad-hoc convoys could also be created.\nLevel 5 \u2013 The fully automated vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger. According to ERTRAC only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10.\n \n3. Regulatory and legal frameworks, state of play\nRoad traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness.\nOne of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept, as laid down in Article 8, that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. The amended convention (20XX-1) still demands that every vehicle must have a driver. However, in the future it will be in accordance with the Convention that highly automated systems will have a driver who may take the hands off the wheel, but must be ready at all times to take over the driving functions, and who can override the system and switch it on and off. A further amendment process is therefore necessary to permit driverless vehicles. Systems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.\nThe regulatory environment relating to cyber security, data privacy, and liability issues is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles. Regulation of automated vehicles faces challenges to establish rules for technologies not yet applied. In particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed. Traffic rules and the regulatory framework need to be adapted. In addition, it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom. The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of driving education and licensing.\nEU Commission should be ready to propose rules on robotics and artificial intelligence, in order to fully exploit their economic potential and to guarantee a standard level of safety and security. As regulatory standards for robots are being planned in several countries, the EU needs to take the lead on setting these standards, so as not to be forced to follow those set by third countries.\nTraffic accidents have very large costs in economic terms, in particular regarding human lives or health, or regarding damage to an object. Liability law answers the question of who is responsible and who has to bear the costs of an accident. Relevant legislation is urgently needed to clarify liability issues, especially for self-driving cars. A mandatory insurance scheme and a supplementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driverless cars are fully compensated is needed. In addition, a specific legal status for robots in the long run, should be established in order to identify who is liable if they cause damage.\nRegarding ethics the creation of a European agency for robotics and artificial intelligence, to supply public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise should be considered.\n4.  Ongoing work in the EU\nIn the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products (Council Directive 85/374/EEC). A producer is liable for any damage caused by a defect in his product; a product is defective when it does not provide the safety which the consumer is entitled to expect. However, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved \u2014 the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States.\nSystems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.\nThe debate on data privacy regarding connected automated vehicles is evolving in parallel with the new technologies. In general, digital services will be available in vehicles, as they are anywhere else. As third parties can access and use sensitive driver and driving data, legislation seems necessary to protect personal privacy of consumers in connected vehicles.The new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regard to digital technologies, valid across the EU.\nThe EP resently (16-03-20xx) voted a resolution for the establishment of EU legislation for the fast-evolving field of robotics, e.g. to enforce ethical standards or establish liability for accidents involving driverless cars. In addition, the European Commission promised dedicated funding, regulatory changes, cross-border agreements and innovation stimulus. The first step in a roadmap, was published by the Commission as part of its transport strategy last May, that could see driverless cars integrated with traffic by 20XX+10.\n", "completion": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}

She assured that industry interests will not dominate the decision-making process and that the strong message from European citizens regarding animal rights and welfare will be respected.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \n\nIntroduction and background\nThis briefing note summarises the main remaining issues in the preparation of our draft proposal for the revised animal welfare regulation. Following the impact assessment concluded last year, a legislative proposal has been prepared and the inter-service consultation was recently concluded. We received positive opinions except for one negative opinion from DG AGRI, setting a condition regarding the preferred option for banning cages for laying hens.\n\nMain issues\nThe legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: \nrestricting the use of cages/crates;\nending the killing of day-old male chickens;\nbanning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and\nsetting animal welfare requirements at import.\n\nThe legislative proposal is based on the medium or high ambition option for all these measures. The cost-benefit analysis from the impact assessment showed that this would be the most efficient way forward. It is also in line with the outcomes of our stakeholder consultations and pressure from citizens. \n\nOther DGs support our draft proposal except when it comes to the ban on cages for laying hens. DG AGRI are concerned about the risk of unfair competition and raised food prices as a result of a cage ban. They therefore issued a negative opinion in the inter-service consultation. DG AGRI wants to see the low-ambition option (phase-in of a cage ban over 12 years) or even no legislative change at all, whereas the DG SANTE preferred option is the high-ambition option with phase-in over 5 years and no exceptions made. We would also like to see the ban combined with space requirements to ensure that free-range hens have sufficient living area. Sufficient space per animal is also needed for health and safety reasons including to minimise the risk of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nIt is true that this high-ambition option would have an impact on food pricing, though our impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. The main limitation is that poultry farmers will be able to house fewer birds per square meter. To some extent, farmers could be compensated for this via the Common Agricultural Policy or other economic incentives.\n\nFor small farmers, this seems not to be a main issue, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. In several Member States, the cage ban will also make no difference as they already adopted a ban within their national legislation. For internal market purposes, a cage ban would therefore help create a more level playing field.\n\nA more important problem is the competition with imported goods from third countries. This seems to be the real core concern of DG AGRI. Among our proposed options, we did propose to require stricter animal welfare rules also for imported animals and animal products, though our impact assessment implied that the medium ambition option would be the most cost-efficient choice.\n\nOptions for the way forward\nThere seems to be two main options for the way forward: compromise on the cage ban or compromise on the import rules.\n\nA compromise on the cage ban for laying hens would mean abandonning our preferred option to settle at the low or medium options instead. This would still be an improvement compared to the current situation. However, it is likely that the Commission would then be heavily criticised by NGOs as well as by the European Parliament who called for a total ban in shorter time. \n\nThe other possibility would be to focus instead on the real underlying problem raised by DG AGRI: the risk of unfair competition from third countries. DG AGRI have indicated that the transition time and exceptions for small farms are not the real problem, so a compromise solution on the cage ban proposal is not necessarily in their best interest. We could instead try to convince them to change their current position and accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages, in exchange for instead increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).\n\nThis would however require another round of talks also with DG TRADE who gave a positive opinion in the inter-service consultation. We have no information about their willingness to agree to such a compromise.\n\nConclusion\nOur recommendation is to, as a first priority, seek a compromise with DG AGRI based on stricter import rules. This would address their main concern while not compromising our preferred options or lowering the level of ambition for animal welfare.\n\nIf this fails, the fallback option could be to strike a compromise based on a longer phase-in period of the cage ban (low or medium ambition option).\n\nIf you agree to this plan of action, we can start informally consulting DG AGRI and DG TRADE immediately\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nBriefing Note on the draft revised animal welfare regulation, version 1 June 202X\nIntroduction - In April 202X-2, the European Commission committed to proposing legislation before the end of 202X to phase out the use of animal cages, with a view to eventually prohibit them. This echoes growing concerns among the European population for what regards animal welfare. This Note aims to provide an analysis of the situation, the reasoning behind the proposed regulation and its potential benefits. \nMain argument - The proposed regulation will enhance animal welfare by introducing a system whereby the use of animal cages will be gradually phased out. This will also serve the purpose of providing an answer to growing concerns among the European population for the welfare of animals, which -as is widely documented- is an important topic for many citizens. However, there are significant challenges to this initiative. The changes that will need to be implemented if the new piece of legislation is adopted will pose several significant challenges:\n- costs incurred by farmers to comply with new standards can be seen as disproportionate\n- higher food prices will negatively impact the poorest families\nThe Directorate General is well aware of the importance of the policy objectives and the need to mitigate its negative consequences for both producers and consumers. On the long-run, the long-term sustainability of our agricultural sector will be enhanced.\nConclusion - By proposing this new piece of legislation, the Commission aims to strike a balance between agricultural productivity and and the long term well-being of our agricultural sector.\n", "completion": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 6.0\n\n"}

She assured that industry interests will not dominate the decision-making process and that the strong message from European citizens regarding animal rights and welfare will be respected.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the case study. \n\nIntroduction and background\nThis briefing note summarises the main remaining issues in the preparation of our draft proposal for the revised animal welfare regulation. Following the impact assessment concluded last year, a legislative proposal has been prepared and the inter-service consultation was recently concluded. We received positive opinions except for one negative opinion from DG AGRI, setting a condition regarding the preferred option for banning cages for laying hens.\n\nMain issues\nThe legislative proposal includes new or stricter rules in four areas: \nrestricting the use of cages/crates;\nending the killing of day-old male chickens;\nbanning painful and unnecessary mutilations; and\nsetting animal welfare requirements at import.\n\nThe legislative proposal is based on the medium or high ambition option for all these measures. The cost-benefit analysis from the impact assessment showed that this would be the most efficient way forward. It is also in line with the outcomes of our stakeholder consultations and pressure from citizens. \n\nOther DGs support our draft proposal except when it comes to the ban on cages for laying hens. DG AGRI are concerned about the risk of unfair competition and raised food prices as a result of a cage ban. They therefore issued a negative opinion in the inter-service consultation. DG AGRI wants to see the low-ambition option (phase-in of a cage ban over 12 years) or even no legislative change at all, whereas the DG SANTE preferred option is the high-ambition option with phase-in over 5 years and no exceptions made. We would also like to see the ban combined with space requirements to ensure that free-range hens have sufficient living area. Sufficient space per animal is also needed for health and safety reasons including to minimise the risk of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nIt is true that this high-ambition option would have an impact on food pricing, though our impact assessment shows a lower price impact than what DG AGRI claims. The main limitation is that poultry farmers will be able to house fewer birds per square meter. To some extent, farmers could be compensated for this via the Common Agricultural Policy or other economic incentives.\n\nFor small farmers, this seems not to be a main issue, as cage rearing is mostly done by large-scale industrial farms. In several Member States, the cage ban will also make no difference as they already adopted a ban within their national legislation. For internal market purposes, a cage ban would therefore help create a more level playing field.\n\nA more important problem is the competition with imported goods from third countries. This seems to be the real core concern of DG AGRI. Among our proposed options, we did propose to require stricter animal welfare rules also for imported animals and animal products, though our impact assessment implied that the medium ambition option would be the most cost-efficient choice.\n\nOptions for the way forward\nThere seems to be two main options for the way forward: compromise on the cage ban or compromise on the import rules.\n\nA compromise on the cage ban for laying hens would mean abandonning our preferred option to settle at the low or medium options instead. This would still be an improvement compared to the current situation. However, it is likely that the Commission would then be heavily criticised by NGOs as well as by the European Parliament who called for a total ban in shorter time. \n\nThe other possibility would be to focus instead on the real underlying problem raised by DG AGRI: the risk of unfair competition from third countries. DG AGRI have indicated that the transition time and exceptions for small farms are not the real problem, so a compromise solution on the cage ban proposal is not necessarily in their best interest. We could instead try to convince them to change their current position and accept the high-ambition proposal on laying hen cages, in exchange for instead increasing the level of ambition in terms of the export rules (full alignment with EU rules also for third countries).\n\nThis would however require another round of talks also with DG TRADE who gave a positive opinion in the inter-service consultation. We have no information about their willingness to agree to such a compromise.\n\nConclusion\nOur recommendation is to, as a first priority, seek a compromise with DG AGRI based on stricter import rules. This would address their main concern while not compromising our preferred options or lowering the level of ambition for animal welfare.\n\nIf this fails, the fallback option could be to strike a compromise based on a longer phase-in period of the cage ban (low or medium ambition option).\n\nIf you agree to this plan of action, we can start informally consulting DG AGRI and DG TRADE immediately\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nEuropean Commission\nDG SANTE\nAnimal Welfare Unit\nBriefing note\n1st of June 202X\nFor the attention of Ms Heinrich, Director-General\nSubject: Animal welfare legislative proposal\nReference: Impact assessment report on Animal welfare: revised regulation of 13 October 202X-1\nBackground:\nLast year, the European Comission has prepared an working document of Animal welfare regulation. This year, there was an inter-service consultation with DG AGRI, DG ENV, DG TRADE on animal welfare regulation, on 16/05/202X. Conventional livestock production systems across EU countries are put under pressure by competitive global markets. The pressure to have lower prices on certain foods has led to intensification of farming with negative effect on animal welfare. The purpose of this briefing is to make more clarity towards the decision of which option to choose for the animal welfare regulation.\nPolicy objectives:\nA. Phasing out confining cages\nA general transition period needed.\nB. Banning the killing of day-old male chiks\nIn case of a ban, a transition period need to be combined with stricter import rules. \nC. Banning paintfull mutilations\nIncentives for voluntary action would enter into force imediatelly. \nD. Annimal welfare requirements at import\nSimilar or fully equivalent. \nI. Main issues and remaining problems to solve\n1. - There is a pressure to reduce production costs, which leads to conditions and equipment they may harm the animals. \n2. - Around three hundred million farmed animals are confined in cages every year accross Europe. No single EU country is cage free.\n3. - Not all the DG agree with the line of the animal welfare regulation. The current legislation is outdated, fragmented and too general. \n4. - Need to choose between ethics and prices. The impact of imposing the animal welfare regulation will lead to increase in prices. For the moment there is a lack of incentives to invest in animal welfare. A partial or total ban on cages would have an important economic impact on the sectors concerned. \nII. Arguments and facts to ease a decision - the way foreward on animal welfare regulation\nDG AGRI does not yet agree with DG SANTE main line on animal welfare regulation. The number of poultry cage need to be determined or incetives to the farmers to ba established.  \nStrengths\n- we received confirmation from DG ENV that the proposal is in line with the European Green Deal objectives\n- increase animal welfare protection\nDisadvantages\n- the big farmers cannot compete with cage free adoption because they would need more space, as underlines DG AGRI. This will lead to a price increase of 20-40% in countries like Spain, Portugal and Malta. \n- the European farmers will not be able to compete with third countries producers, who do not take into account animal welfare.\nIn conclusion\nThere are 3 types of options: low, medium and high. Medium and high ambition options can be combined with stricter requirements of minimum space per animal and antibiotics to be used. \na. Following the comments received after the interservice consultation, the low ambition option or status quo should apply for protecting the market and ensure competitive pricing of food products for animal welfare. \nb. As the citizens are putting pressure through an European initiative, a decision on animal welfare should be taken asap. \nc. Regarding the poultry cage rearing, the smaller the farms, easier it is for them to implement cage free rearing.\nd. The domino effect will start from animal welfare regulation - higher food prices - burden on poor families. DG AGRI proposal of incentives seem to be a solution. \nRecommendation prefered on animal welfare regulation\nIn conclusion there is an urge to implement as soon as possible the 'cage free' legislation for animals, accompagned by a cost/efficiency analysis. In parallel to the legislation, in order to facilitate a balanced economy, financial support and incentives may be provided through the new eco-schemes instrument of DG AGRI. Accepting the economic compensations to poultry farming will suggested by DG AGRI, will unblock our proposal on animal welfare regulation. \nThe legislation should be more specific and sustanable, in accordance to the European Green Deal Objectives. Last, but not least, awarness -raising of consumers, economic incentives via the Common Agricultural Policy and import rules to ensure a level of competition. \nTherefore a mix between medium and high ambition options is preferred.\n", "completion": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 6.0\n\n"}

This requires an effective legislative framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of legitimate concerns, the first of which is safety. |  | The blueprint outlines the proposed vision for U-space and how it could be rolled out. Rather than providing a definitive solution, this blueprint provides the basis to better define the way drones will operate in Europe in the future.   |  |  | OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS OF UNMANNED OR REMOTELY PILOTED VEHICLES IN THE EUROPEAN AIRSPACE |  | Drones have been used to shoot weddings, Hollywood movies and terrorists. But now drones are navigating a third path between hobbyists and warfare into the industrial world.  |  | New uses for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging almost daily: delivering packages, pizzas and blood; surveying mines; pre-emptive firefighting; and crime investigations.  |  | According to Gerald Van Hoy, senior research analyst at Gartner, 3 million drones are expected to be shipped this year, and this should translate into revenues of $6 Billion. However, drones pose an array of threats, and reports of drone-related accidents and near-misses are on the rise. Moreover, we can no longer rely on fences or barriers around our homes to protect our privacy and drones without adequate security in place will be vulnerable to hacks, as well as physical attacks.  |  | Theft of data is another real risk, particularly if the drone contains personal or sensitive information, whether this is customer data included for delivery purposes or footage collected via an attached camera.  |  | Accident liability and insurance related legislation is yet to be developed and public acceptance is key to the development of the industry. |  | U-SPACE \u2013 A BLUEPRINT FOR DRONE USE IN LOW-LEVEL AIRSPACE |  | U-space is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for large numbers of drones.  |  | These services rely on a high level of digitalisation and automation of functions, whether they are on board the drone itself or part of the ground-based environment.  |  | U-space provides an enabling framework to support routine drone operations, as well as a clear and effective interface to manned aviation. |  | The delivery of U-space relies upon the following key principles: | To ensure the safety of all airspace users operating in the U-space framework, as well as people on the ground. | To provide a scalable, flexible and adaptable system that can respond to changes in demand, volume, technology, business models and applications, while managing the interface with manned aviation. | To enable high-density operations with multiple automated drones under the supervision of fleet operators. | To guarantee equitable and fair access to airspace for all users. | To enable competitive and cost-effective service provision at all times, supporting the business models of drone operators. | To minimise deployment and operating costs by leveraging as much of the existing aeronautical services and infrastructure as possible, including GNSS as well as those from other sectors, such as mobile communication services. | To accelerate deployment by adopting technologies and standards from other sectors where they meet the needs of U-space. | To follow a risk-based and performance-driven approach when setting up appropriate requirements for safety, security and resilience, while minimising environmental impact and respecting the privacy of citizens, including data protection. |  | Subject to compliance with applicable regulations, operational limitations and technical requirements linked to the operation of the drone, U-space facilitates any kind of mission, from the delivery of goods, aerial work, and search and rescue, to more complex future applications such as urban air mobility. |  | U-space services are offered to both private and public users of drones, for all types of missions.  |  | In addition, the criticality of these services will lead to the establishment of performance requirements for both structural elements and service delivery, covering, for example, safety, security, availability, continuity and resilience. |  | NEXT STEPS |  | The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules that are proportionate to the risk of the operation.  | These rules will implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which the European Parliament and the Council (i.e. the EU Member States) are expected to adopt in the coming months. |  | The Commission, through the SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system. |  | CONCLUSIONS |  | The U-space framework comprises an extensive and scalable range of services relying on agreed EU standards and delivered by service providers.  |  | These services do not look to replicate the function of air traffic control. However, they do deliver key services to organise the safe and efficient operation of drones, ensuring a proper interface with manned aviation, ATC and relevant authorities.  |  |  |  | (signed) | <your name> | DG Mobility and Transport |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nINTERNAL NOTE (DG Mobility and Transport)\nThis internal note aims at assisting the press office to prepare a press release announcing the publication, by the Single Europeas Sky Air traffic management Research (SESAR) Joint Undertaking, of its blueprint for drone use in low-level air space.

Opportunities of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace\n- Employement and growth:\nAccording to the European Air Safety Agency (EASA), unmanned aircraft has great potential for producing new jobs and growth.\n- New or better services:\nIn its Riga Declaration \"Framing the future of aviation\", the European aviation community further advocates that drones offer new services and applications going beyond traditional aviation and offer the promise to perform existing services in a more affordable and environmetal friedly way.\nThis aspect was also hightlighted in the press, where several potential benefits of drones have been put forward, from Amazon deliveries to rescue missions and fight against crime.\n1.2. Threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace:\n- Safety:\nSome concerns have been raised in the press that \"saferty occurences\" involving drones in Europe are on the rise, potentially posing a threat to recreational and commercial planes. Similar concerns have been raised by the European aviation community, which stated, in its recent Rega Declaration, that, althoigh no one is on board of a drone, people in other aicraft or on the ground could get hurt in case of an accident or an unscheduled landing.\n- Noise:\nThe European aviation community also identified other risks linked to the use of drones, such as nuisances and negatice externalities.\n- Right to privacy:\nIn its recent Riga Declaration, the European aviation community also raised concerns with respect to the protection of fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, as many drones involve data-gathering such as filming.\n- Security threats:\nAnother risk which has been put forward is the potential security risk linked to the malicious use of drones.\nIt can thus be said that the use of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace both has a lot of potential to foster European leadership and competitiveness, but also implied important risks that need to be mitigated through an effective legal framework.\n2. The blueprint for drone use in low-level air space\nThe purpose of this blueprint is to make drone use in low-level airspace safe, secure and environmentallu friendly. It will pave the way for the development of a strong and dynamic EU drone services market.\nThis blueprint oulines the proposed vision for the concept of \"U-space\", which is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace (altitudes of up to 150 meters) for large number of drones.\nThis paper outiles a number of basic principles:\ni) Safety at low level altitude levels:\nThe concept is to develop a system similar to that of Air Traffic Management (ATM) for manned aviation.\nii) Automated system:\nThe system will provide information for highly automated or autonomous drones to fly safely and avoid obstacles or collisions.\niii) Partly up and running by 20XX+2:\nIt will be the case for basic services like registration, e-identification and geo-fencing.\n", "completion": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}

The legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of batteries, from raw material supply chain to production, reuse, and recycling. The proposal aligns with the European Green Deal, Circular Economy Action Plan, and New Industrial Strategy. The Council and European Parliament have reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. An internal reflection and brainstorming meeting is planned to fine-tune the original proposal in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators.\n\nCase Study Content: \nHeadline: Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to build a resilient lithium supply chain\n\nSummary: Europe is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for lithium, a key metal used in batteries for electric vehicles. The European Union (EU) plans to release its Critical Raw Materials Act, which will identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk. The EU aims to become climate neutral by 2050 and has set ambitious goals for the electrification of transportation. However, challenges faced by carmakers and concerns about supply availability and access to raw materials continue to impact the growth of the electric vehicle market in Europe.\n\nHeadline: European Commission considers classifying lithium as toxic\n\nSummary: The European Commission is considering a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If approved, this classification could undermine the EU's efforts to create a domestic battery materials supply chain. The EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium for its electric vehicle production sector, and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions. The proposal could have an impact on lithium mining, processing, cathode production, and recycling.\n\nHeadline: The Inflation Reduction Act stimulates battery mineral mining in the US\n\nSummary: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US is expected to stimulate a \"gold rush\" in battery mineral mining, refining, and production. The IRA offers tax credits for various stages of battery production and the battery supply chain, making it more appealing for companies to bring full-cycle battery production to the US. This includes mining and refining battery minerals, producing battery cells, and battery pack production. The IRA aims to reduce the US's dependence on China for battery minerals and increase domestic production.\n\nHeadline: Russia plans to start lithium mining in the next few years\n\nSummary: Russia is planning to start lithium mining based on ore deposits in the Murmansk region within the next three to four years. The country has significant lithium reserves, accounting for 10% of the world's reserves. The demand for lithium is expected to increase in the next decade, and Russia aims to become one of the world's top five producers of lithium. The next stage of Russia's lithium industry development will be the application of technologies for lithium production from solutions found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields.\n\nHeadline: Meeting the growing demand for lithium in the electric vehicle industry\n\nSummary: The demand for lithium is expected to rise significantly due to the growing electric vehicle industry. Despite the expected increase in demand, the lithium industry is expected to provide enough supply to meet the needs of the lithium-ion battery industry. In addition to increasing conventional lithium supply, new technologies such as direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP) offer promise in increasing supply, reducing the industry's environmental impact, and lowering costs. Battery recycling is also expected to increase, providing a secondary supply of lithium.\n\nSample Referenced Solution: \n\nThe following is an example of a good response to the Case Study. \nMemo | Regulation on batteries and waste batteries | In December 20XX-2, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on batteries and waste batteries. The proposal aims to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery life cycle. The initiative is closely linked to the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the New Industrial Strategy.  | At the end of last year, The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. For the first time the legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of a battery \u2013 from the supply chain of raw materials, over the production to reuse and recycling of batteries \u2013 and ensure that they are safe, sustainable, and competitive. | The purpose of this memo is to launch the interservice consultation procedure for the new Regulation on Batteries and waste batteries. It is intended to structure the review of the original proposal, considering the observations of the Council and the European Parliament, and to further materialize the specific requirements by setting measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based targets and objectives. |  | Context | The European Union (EU) has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Recently proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035. | As sales of electric vehicles increase, carmakers are looking to secure supply of key metals used in batteries, including lithium. Today, Europe is quite dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply and China for lithium refining. While only around 9% of the world's lithium is mined in China, around 60% is refined there. | With expected battery lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles, and the possibility of extending EV battery life through use in the energy-storage sector, battery recycling is expected to increase during the current decade, but not to game-changing levels. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. By 2030, such secondary supply is expected to account for slightly more than 6 percent of total lithium production. | Although Europe is pushing to build a resilient supply chain by partnering with allies and developing domestic resources, it might not all be good news for miners in the region \u2014 at the end of last year, the European Commission said it will weigh a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, recycling, and handling of the materials.  |  | Agenda | General  | The new regulation should apply to all batteries including all waste portable batteries, electric vehicle batteries, industrial batteries, starting, lightning and ignition batteries, and batteries for light means of transport (e.g., electric bikes, e-mopeds, e-scooters). | Supply chain of raw materials | EU needs to boost its local mining and refining capacity and shift more towards trustworthy suppliers.  | Target for local mining: cover the EU needs for XX% by 20XX+Y.  | Due diligence of raw materials\u2019 origin, carbon intensity requirements and more efficient use of raw materials. Target date: end of 20XX+Y. Possible exemption for SMEs from the due diligence rules (to be discussed). | Refinery: More recycled content in new batteries second life for industrial batteries. Targets for producers to collect waste portable batteries (XX% by the end of 20XX+Y). Introduction of dedicated collection objective for waste batteries for light means of transport (YY% by the end of 20XX+Y). | Market: Promote a circular battery industry, market for secondary raw materials, clearer labelling, and information with \u201cbattery passports\u201d and QR codes | End of use: Strict collection schemes and recycling targets, better ways of re-using old batteries, battery traceability, more efficient recycling of waste batteries, ensure the environmentally sound treatment of waste batteries, incentives for further recycling. | Production of batteries in the EU | 20XX+1: additional investment of \u20acXX billion in R&D for European battery production and electric cars. | Targets: by 20XX+Y Local producers cover the EU's demand and by 20XX+Y, EU produces next generation battery and EV technologies.  | By 20XX+Y, the EU sets a global sustainable standard in the global market. | Functioning of the internal market  | The new rules aim to improve the functioning of the internal market for batteries and ensure fairer competition. This will be reached through performance, durability and safety criteria, tight restrictions for hazardous substances like mercury, cadmium and lead and mandatory information on the carbon footprint of batteries. The regulation also introduces labelling and information requirements, among other things on the battery's components and recycled content, and an electronic \u201cbattery passport\u201d and a QR code. | Setting of a realistic implementation schedule.\u00a0Notably, labelling requirements will apply after XX months after entry into force of the Regulation and after XX months for the QR code. |  |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n01/03/20XX\nDear Ferdinand\nI am back to you with the memo as you have requested. If you have any comment I can modify the memo still today. \nBACKGROUND\nThe goals of the European green deal and other climate change policies have underlined the strategic role plaied by batteries on reaching the environmental objectives. In fact, the batteries are necessary to boost the production of energy from renewable sources. \nThe political agreement at EU level on the battery regulation is an important step. However, lithium, a key batteries material which is at the core of the batteries production cycle, is interested by a series of issues. These issues may compromise the goal of the proposal which aims at safe, sustainble and competitive batteries.\nIn fact, from the adoption of the regulation by the Commission, the context is changed. Outside the EU, the US may become extremely attractive to establish lithium production cycles on their territory by means of the IRA. Within the EU, the possible upcoming decision of the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) about the risk for human health because of certain key lithium salts, may compromise our internal investments on lithium supply and refining. \nMAIN ISSUES\nLithium is a key component of batteries. The global lithium demand will increase enormously in the next decade, and the global offer of lithium might not keep up the speed of the demand. This situation might be particularly critical in the EU where the lithium demand will be higher than in the rest of the world and the lithium mining and production is nonexistent. \nNowadays, the EU depends on supply and refinement of Lithium from third countries. Opening lithium mines and establishing lithium refinement plants in Europe, as foreseen in the proposal, will reduce the dependency from the third countries.\nHowever, if ECHA will decide to classify some key lithium salts hazardous for human health, its is expected that there will be an increase in the costs for mining and producing lithium in Europe, with potential exodus of investors.\nIn addition, on the other side of the Athlantic, the IRA makes extremely attractive to base lithium mining and refinement in the US terriotry.\nWAY FORWARD\nIt is necessary to impement new measures in the batteries regulation to prevent troubles for the european market and update the regulation to the new context.\nFirstly, regarding the production chain of batteries, we need to align the attractiveness of the EU market to those determined in the US by means of the IRA. Therefore we must value the production made in the EU and grant an incentive for each major stage of the production process. \nSecondly, independently from the ECHA decision, we cannot exclude that in future additional risks for human health will arise in the batteries product chain. Therefore we need to integrate the batteries regulation with a system that values the production chains that respect the EU law in terms of protection of the human health and on the other hand hinders those production chains that do not comply with the requirements for human health established by the EU. \nIn the long run, we will be able also to count on lithium recycling and on the use of new technologies like Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) and Direct Lithium to production (DLP), and the use of materials alternative to lithium can be explored. However, we need to invest on EU reserach to make these paths much more concrete.\nBefore our internal meeting, I will reach our collegues in ECHA for an update on the potential ban for certain lithium salts (the decision was expected by the beginning of this year). In case the ECHA will ban key lithiums salts, a revision of the impact assessment for the batteries regulation is desirable, the feasibility of this has to be checked during the internal meeting.\nAGENDA\nI've kept the agenda very simple and focused on our main issues for the ISC consultations: \n1 - Opening;\n2 - The proposal in the new context;\n3 - Fine-tuning the proposal:\n- the new global context  and attractiveness of the EU market;\n- valuing protection of human health in the batteries production chain;\n4 - Next steps for the fine-tuning of the proposal;\n5 - Closing of the meeting.\nI am available to support you on introducing points 3 ad 4 in partiular.  \nLooking forward\nYOU\n", "completion": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}

As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure. Vehicle automation also has the potential to be more environmentally friendly, efficient and accessible. |  | 2. POTENTIAL AND CHALLENGES OF VEHICLE AUTOMATION |  | Few people seem to fully grasp the profound improvement in our lives that driverless cars will bring: |  | According to the European Commission, automated driving will increase road safety significantly, as human error is involved in more than 90% of all traffic accidents on Europe's roads.  | Self-driving cars will remove a lot of vehicles from city streets because self-driving cars won\u2019t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers. | Because fewer shared vehicles will be necessary to provide the same service that personally owned vehicles provide there will be a substantial reduction in the cost of car ownership. | With no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient.  | Self-driving cars will also benefit other groups who currently cannot drive an individual car; children, elderly people or people with a disability. |  | However, the deployment of automated vehicles raises many questions around ethical, legal, financial, economic and technical implications: |  | Established rules for this technology have not yet been put in place, in particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed and it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom.   | In case of malfunction of an automated vehicle it is not clear as to who is liable when such malfunctions result in an accident: the manufacturer, the owner or the driver. | The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of traffic rules, driving education and licensing. | The growing use of vehicle automation also raises ethical issues, for example with privacy and safety.  | There will be a tremendous impact on the workforce, not only by taking away jobs from drivers but also by requiring different qualifications and skill sets of workers in the car industry. | The transition period during which human-driven cars and automated cars will be sharing the roads will extend over several decades. |  | 3. DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTOMATION AND THEIR DEPLOYMENT |  | For an effective communication between the technological and political spheres, categorisation and terminology are being developed which define different levels of vehicle automation. |  | Currently, different ways of categorising the levels of automation exist in parallel, but many organisations follow the classification set by the International Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE): |  | Level 0: Park Distance Control - The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals. | Level 1: Park Assist - The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces.  | Level 2: Traffic Jam Assist - The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h).  | Level 3: Traffic Jam Chauffeur - Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads.  | Level 4: Highway Pilot - Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. | Level 5: Fully automated vehicle - The vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger.  |  | As of today, levels 0 to 3 are already deployed on our roads, level 4 will become available over the next few years and for level 5 only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10. |  | 4. REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORKS - STATE OF PLAY |  | The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968 ('Vienna Convention of 1968') is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety by establishing standard traffic rules among the contracting parties. All EU Member States are signatories of the Vienna Convention \u2013 only the UK and Spain have not endorsed it.  |  | One of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. It is a very long and slow process to change treaties on the UN level, therefore the EU might take the lead in updating legislation and the UN can follow later.  |  | 5. ONGOING WORK IN THE EU |  | The European Union and its Member States participate in international working groups which are revising the regulations as prerequisites for the deployment of automated vehicles. Technical requirements for vehicles are internationally harmonised in the framework of the two following UNECE Agreements: |  | The 1958 Agreement provides the framework for establishing international UN Regulations with uniform performance\u2014oriented test provisions and administrative procedures for granting type approvals, for the conformity of production and for the mutual recognition of the type approvals granted.  | The 1998 Agreement concerns the establishing of global technical regulations for the construction of new vehicles, including performance requirements. Its purpose is to further enhance the process of international harmonisation through the development of global technical regulations (GTR).  |  | The common legal framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers is provided by a Framework Directive. Within the EU, mass-produced cars may only be used on public roads if they are type-approved in compliance with the administrative procedures and technical requirements established by the Directive. |  | The regulatory environment relating to cyber security and data privacy is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles. The new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regards to digital technologies - including vehicle automation, valid across the EU. |  | In the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products. However, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved \u2014 the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States. |  | Furthermore, the European Union is funding research on automated road transport as a priority in the Horizon 2020 Transport Research programme.  |  |  | 6. CONCLUSION |  | Road traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness in the ever-globalising world. |  |\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nBriefing Note / DG Mobility and Transport\nAutomated vehicle technologies allow the transfer of driving functions from a human driver to a computer. Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility. However,automated vehicle technologies require an effective legislative framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of legitimate concerns.\nPotentials and challenges of vehicle automation\nPotential benefits of vehicle automation\n1. Increased road safety: As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure for drivers and pedestrians alike. A KPMG report predicts an 80% drop in accidents in 20 years.\n2. Environmental benefits: Vehicles will be lighter and more fuel efficient which will lead to reduced energy demand. In addition, their used is optimised and they pick up and drop customers constantly without needing to spend energy and time looking for parking (i.e. in peak hours, these vehicles will be used 90% of the time in large cities).\n3. Increased affordability of car ownership/sharing: The costs of car ownership are expected to drop by 75%.\n4. Accesibility: People with reduced mobility, disability or living in rural areas will have easier access to mobility services.\nChallenges and drawbacks\n1. Unclear liability in case of accidents: Although reduced, accidents will continue happening and there needs to be a way to ensure that the liabile party is clear and that victims are compensated.\n2. Ethical issues: Given the data driven nature of driveless car sharing, some privacy and data safety issues will emerge. The automated systems will also take decisions (e.g. among different options in a car crash scenario) which will need ethical oversight.\n3. Job market impacts: The development of the sector might result in the displacement of some jobs and the loss of others. The size of the sector is considerable (e.g. 2% of US total employment).\n4. Difficulties adapting to fragmeted road traffic regulation: Europe has different national juristdictions when it comes to road traffic and this can inder the deployment of new technologies for systems or vehicles.\nThe different levels of automation and their deployment\nLevels of Automation\nThere are different levels of automation ranging from already deployed mechanisms like park assistance or traffic jam assistance to vehicles without a driving wheel.\nThe US Department of Transportations's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) an dETRAC provide different definitions of 5 levels of automation. All in all, there are 3 stages whose differences will be determinan for regulation and insurance: Automated, Autonomous and Driveress.\nDeployment\nThe first commercial uses of the technology are likely to be driverless trucks first deployed as part of convoys lead by a driven vehicle and then as fully autonomous series of automated trucks. Motorways will be the safets place for CAD test as they are pedestrian free, often straight and uniform across Europe.\nRegulatory and legal frameworks, state of play\nThe Vienna Convention on Road Traffic from 1968 (ratified by all EU MS except of Spain) is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and increase road safety by establishing stadard traffic rules among parties. However, Article 8 establishes that the driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. Its amendment still demands that each vehicle must have a driver so the Convention needs to be further amended to adapt to driverless vehicles and clarified as different countries are choosing to interpret Article 8 in different ways.\nAn EU regulation of the sector could mean that the EC sents the standards for the later international UN treaty, which could take up to 5 years to modify.\nTechnical requirements for Vehicles are harmonised in the framework of two UNECE agreements (1958 and 1998) where the EU is a contracting party. In addition, Certificates of Conformity, issued by any EU member state, certifying that a vehicle meets all relevant legal requirements, are accepted in all other members.\nRegulatory standards for robots are being planned in several countries and the EU needs to take the lead on setting the standards to avoid having to follow standards set by others.he regulation of the sector will need to overcome the challenges identified including the harmonization of traffic regulations and vehicle requirements but also data processing, liability issues, infrastructure and vehicle to vehicle (V2V) interoperability.\nOngoing work in the EU\nThe White Paper on the Furture of Europe identifies autonomous vehicles as an areas where the EU can deliver tangible benefits to citizens.\nThe Commission foresees to publish a Roadmap as part of the EU Transport Strategy on the 31st of May.\nNational EU leaders signed an agreement in Rome to allow cross-border tests and experiments with autonomous vehicles and to establish a national contact point to approve them.\nSuggestions from the European Parliament to develop EU standards for the sector include:\n1. Creating a specific legal status for robots to establish who is liable in case of accidents.\n2. Making inusrance mandatory and creating a supplementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driveless cars are compensated\n3. Creating a European Agency for robotics and artificial intelligence to support public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise in the field.\n4. The creation of a voluntary ethical code of conduct on robotics for researchers and designers could ensure that they operate in accordance with legal and ethical standards while respecting human dignity.\n", "completion": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}
