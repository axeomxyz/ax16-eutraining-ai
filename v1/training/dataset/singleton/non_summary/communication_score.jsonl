This will increase their chances of achieving a passing grade or higher in the formal\n    EU examination process.\n    \n    3 Basic Principles\n    - Be objective, respectful, and professional. Remember that the candidate deserves to be treated with respect. Equally, be aware that they are probably writing in a language that is not their primary tongue. Use simple, understandable language in your feedback.\n    - Be specific and constructive. Avoid general statements like \"good job\" or \"needs improvement.\" Focus on specific areas where the candidate can improve, such as content management, grammar, sentence structure, clarity, and organization.\n    - Be timely. Give the candidate feedback as soon as possible so that they have time to learn from their mistakes and apply your feedback suggestions. \n\n    \n    Providing Your Feedback\n    - Comment on the content and style elements, not the author.\n    - Be objective, concise, and clear in your feedback.\n    - Provide feedback that assists the author to improve.\n    \n    Specific Feedback\n    When providing feedback on a written text, you should consider the following areas:\n    - Content: Does the text address all of the required elements of the assignment? Is the information accurate and well-researched? Are there adequate quantitative data provided? Are sources attributed and appropriately referenced? Isn\u2019t referencing too much (no need for academic-style citation), or too limited? \n    - Grammar and mechanics: Check for errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.\n    - Sentence structure: Look for sentences that are too long or complex, or that are not well structured. Does each paragraph focus on one key concept, and each sentence addresses one key argument? Or there is a mix of concepts, arguments, suggestions? \n    - Clarity: Is the text easy to read? Does it have a logical flow? Is it visually pleasing to the reader?\n    - Organization: Consider whether the text is well-organized and easy to follow. In the \u2018new\u2019 format of case studies, there isn\u2019t always a need for introduction/body/conclusion, but some context needs to be given, key recommendations or points for or against a certain position, with proper background information, facts and references, along with logically sequenced arguments. Does the writing follow a \u2018red thread\u2019 or does it go all over the place? Does the brief require specific recommendations? If so these should be in a separate titled section.\n    - Style: What is the intended audience? (European Commission head of unit, general public, journalists, subject matter experts, others?) Is the writing style appropriate for that audience? Is its tone formal or informal? Is it concise and jargon-free (or is the jargon defined)? Does the author inappropriately assume a reader's prior knowledge of the issue? Is there any bias evident?\n    \n    Specific Questions when preparing to write your Feedback\n    The following is a series of questions that will assist you in generating appropriate and relevant feedback to the author.\n    1.

The proposal aims to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery life cycle. The initiative is closely linked to the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the New Industrial Strategy. \nAt the end of last year, The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. For the first time the legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of a battery \u2013 from the supply chain of raw materials, over the production to reuse and recycling of batteries \u2013 and ensure that they are safe, sustainable, and competitive.\nAs you know, our unit has the lead on this important file and our DG intends to launch the formal interservice consultation over the coming weeks. Before this, our DG wants to organize an internal reflection and brainstorming meeting, and I have been appointed to chair this meeting.\nCould you produce an internal memo, summarizing the main ins and outs of this file and the agenda for the internal meeting with concrete proposals and recommendations to fine-tune the original proposal, in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators. \nI\u2019m on mission tomorrow so please could you get this done for me today. It doesn\u2019t need to be long \u2013 in fact the shorter, the better.  \n\nMany thanks\n\nCase Study Content: \n,\n\nFerdinand\nHead of Unit\n\n\n\n\nIs Europe Moving Fast Enough to Build a Resilient Lithium Supply Chain? \nPriscila Barrera\nNov. 16, 20XX-1\n\n\nEurope will soon release its Critical Raw Materials Act to identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk.\nEurope\u2019s green energy transition plans give a central role to the electrification of transportation. \nThe European Union (EU) has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Recently proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035.\nIn 20XX-2, electric car registrations for the year were close to 1,729,000, up from 1,061,000 in 2020, with prospects for the region remaining positive. Last year, the market share of battery electric cars almost doubled to around 10 percent, but challenges faced by carmakers continue to weigh on demand as inflation and fears of a recession put pressure on targets. \nIn its most recent forecast, the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA) said it expects the overall EU car market to shrink again this year, slipping by 1 percent to reach 9.6 million units.\n\u201cTo ensure a return to growth \u2014 with an even greater share of electric vehicle sales so climate targets can be met \u2014 we urgently need the right framework conditions to be put in place,\u201d said Oliver Zipse, ACEA president and CEO of BMW. \u201cThese include greater resilience in Europe\u2019s supply chains, an EU Critical Raw Materials Act that ensures strategic access to the raw materials needed for e-mobility, and an accelerated roll-out of charging infrastructure.\u201d\nAs sales of electric vehicles increase, carmakers are looking to secure supply of key metals used in batteries, including lithium. Today, Europe is quite dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply and China for lithium refining, but the region is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for the important battery metal. \nWhat is the European Critical Raw Materials Act? \nIn September, news broke that Europe will be putting forward the European Critical Raw Materials Act, a new piece of legislation. Its aim is to identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc has learned its lesson about the risks of being dependent on Russia, and realizes the need to be vigilant toward China.\n\"In the case of China, it is the risk of dependency on technologies and raw materials,\" she said, adding that the EU needs to boost its production capacity and shift more towards trustworthy suppliers.\nIn October, von der Leyen said the EU is witnessing quite an acceleration of trends and tensions with China. \n\"The Chinese system is fundamentally different from ours and we are aware of the nature of the rivalry,'' she said.\nThe moves from the EU are in line with pushes seen in other regions such as North America, where the US has committed billions of dollars to reach its carbon emissions targets.\nIn June, the Biden administration launched the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate incentives. The legislation, which was signed into law in August, requires automakers to source 50 percent of critical minerals used in electric vehicle batteries from North America or free trade agreement countries by 2024, with that amount rising to 80 percent by the end of 20XX+3.\nFor its part, Canada recently ordered three Chinese companies to divest from lithium companies following a \u201cmulti-step national security review process.\u201d China has opposed the move, and Canada is expected to release its China strategy soon.\nEurope-Asia relationship in the lithium space \nJack Bedder of Project Blue said Asia will always be a part of the European lithium-ion battery supply chain. Major Asian companies, including Panasonic, Samsung, BYD Company and CATL, all have operating capacity on the continent.\n\u201cAs a result, it will be almost impossible to detach fully from Chinese-owned supply across all stages of the lithium-ion supply chain,\u201d he told the Investing News Network.\nHowever, as lithium processing capacity is built up globally at non-Chinese-owned companies, particularly within the EU, the opportunities to reduce the EU's dependency on China-owned supply will improve. \u201cIt is very unlikely that the EU will implement legislation directly prohibiting lithium supply from Chinese-owned companies, as further constraints on supply availability to the European market will only hinder growth in the industry over the coming decade,\u201d Bedder added.\nFor Allan Pedersen of Wood Mackenzie, Europe cannot move forward without influence from Asia in the short to medium term.\nThat\u2019s due to a few reasons. As mentioned, many of the battery plants being constructed in Europe have Asian companies behind them, and the cathodes needed in batteries are still largely produced in Asia, where the know-how is strongest. Additionally, lithium refining is mainly done in China and most mineral concentrate is produced in Australia.\n\u201cChina has a multi-year advantage over the rest of the world in terms of investing in the entire supply chain \u2014 it will be challenging for Europe to catch up to that in terms of investment in know-how, processing equipment and resources,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that Europe cannot make progress in this space. In lithium, we see some resource developments and processing facilities being considered and constructed.\u201d\nFor the analyst, in the long-term Europe has the potential to become more self-sufficient for raw materials as recycling becomes a larger part of the supply landscape and can supplement domestic resources.\nEuropean Commission could classify lithium as toxic. \nAlthough Europe is pushing to build a resilient supply chain by partnering with allies and developing domestic resources, it might not all be good news for miners in the region \u2014 at the end of last year, the European Commission said it will weigh a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride and hydroxide as dangerous for human health.\nIf the proposal is approved, this could undermine the EU\u2019s attempt to create and support a domestic battery materials supply chain, research firm Rystad Energy said in a statement. \u201cThe EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium to supply its nascent electric vehicle production sector and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions, at a time when the union is focused on energy security and reducing emissions,\u201d the document reads.\nIf the classification goes ahead, it would not stop lithium usage, but it is highly likely to have an impact on at least four stages: lithium mining, processing, cathode production and recycling.\n\u201cThis potential ruling comes at a time when the EU is itself scrambling to build and establish local lithium supply chains. The permitting issue has repeatedly been highlighted at recent industry events as one of the main barriers to new mining projects ramping up quickly in the EU,\u201d according to Rystad Energy analysts. \u201cThere is also further risk of potential projects losing local community support for building lithium mines and processing operations.\u201d\nEditorial Disclosure: The Investing News Network does not guarantee the accuracy or thoroughness of the information reported in the interviews it conducts.

The European Chemicals Agency or ECHA initiated the process.\nThe European Union has been making its environmental and climate rules stricter for decades. The administration in Brussels wants to make the entire continent carbon neutral by mid-century. At the same time, it is striving to achieve the highest level of protection from pollution in the world.\nThe energy transition and the decarbonization of industrial activity and power plants imply massive deployment of renewables, mostly solar and wind farms. However, as they depend on unstable weather conditions, the electric power system requires energy storage, in which the EU counts a lot on batteries.\nDangerous critical raw material\nLithium-ion solutions still dominate the sector, though there are other technologies emerging that could popularize less harmful material for home units and the batteries for electronic devices, electric vehicles, and utility systems. At the same time, the European Commission is struggling to secure supply chains that would make the availability of lithium stable and make the EU almost self-sufficient by 20XX+7.\nThe European Union has added lithium to a list of critical raw materials as demand is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years.\nInitiatives to open mines and ore processing plants such as the ones in Serbia and Portugal have caused a public uproar as environmentalists and the local population are fearful about the impact on nature and people\u2019s livelihoods. In other projects, engineers are trying to make the extraction of lithium from geothermal waters cost effective and harmless, without any mining.\nStricter rules for handling lithium would lift costs\nHowever, the entire concept could falter with the European Commission\u2019s upcoming legislation. Namely, it is considering the proposal from the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA, to declare key lithium salts hazardous for human health, Reuters reported. If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, and handling of the materials.\nECHA\u2019s Risk Assessment Committee accepted the demand from France in September to classify lithium salts as damaging for fertility and unborn children and to declare the substances harmful for breastfed children.\nAdding lithium salts to the list of materials hazardous for health may prompt the revision of a range of projects in the industry.\nStricter rules mean higher costs, so any lithium ore processing plant project, like the one in the Jadar area in Serbia, would need to be given a second look regarding its environmental impact and feasibility.\nAlbemarle, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has indicated it may be forced to close its plant in Langelsheim in north Germany if the plan is accepted. In that case, Chief Financial Officer Scott Tozier said, the company wouldn\u2019t be able to import lithium chloride, its primary feedstock.\nThe unit\u2019s annual revenue is USD 500 million, and the plant has over 600 employees. Tozier warned a decision to declare lithium salts hazardous would prompt an exodus of EU producers including battery recyclers.\nThe decision is expected to be reached by early next year, the article adds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Really Big Battery Deal in the IRA That People Are Missing\nBy Zachary Shahan \u2013 Published September 23, 20XX-1\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, almost all the discussion has been around the consumer tax credit for buying an electric vehicle, including the interesting new battery aspects of that. That\u2019s a big topic, but there\u2019s a whole other battery angle separate from the consumer tax credit, and it\u2019s huge.\nThe short summary of the whole thing is that the IRA incentives for nearly every stage of battery production and the battery supply chain are very attractive, and since they stack on top of each other, the IRA is likely to stimulate a \u201cgold rush\u201d of sorts in battery mineral mining, battery mineral refining, battery cell production, battery recycling, and battery pack production in the United States. When you also consider that consumers will need to get batteries whose components don\u2019t come from China, and that come from North America eventually, then it\u2019s essentially a given that everyone in the industry now knows it should have battery mineral mining and refining as well as battery cell and pack production in North America.\n\nSK Innovation Georgia battery factory rendering, courtesy of SK Innovation.\nThe Current EV Battery Mineral Situation\nFirst, let\u2019s note where we\u2019re starting from. The USA currently mines and refines close to 0% of the minerals that go into EV battery packs. China, on the other hands, mines or refines the majority of all the big ones, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. Here\u2019s a chart on Chinese EV battery mineral domination:\n\nMoney, Money, Money\nLooking at the data, the idea that Joe Biden was going to stimulate a gold rush in the EV battery mineral mining and refining space was a dream some of us had, but it seemed like one of the more outlandish dreams we could have in this time and age. However, the market does respond to three things pretty well: money, money, money, and money. And the Biden administration, Prime Minister Manchin, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and others involved in crafting the legislation took note and decided to offer all four.\nThe slight joke here, aimed at emphasizing the key point, is that the IRA seems to be offering cash money (tax credits) for mining battery minerals, for refining battery minerals, for putting together battery cells, and for putting together battery packs (or \u201cmodules\u201d). If you do all those things, you don\u2019t get one bonus, you get four bonuses. If you count all the different minerals in a battery, the number of potential bonuses is much larger. Those bonuses add up, and they make it much more appealing to bring full-cycle battery production to the USA. At the very least, it should open mining and refining projects \u2014 which are more or less non-existent in the United States \u2014 by making them much more bankable. (Side note: Canadian and Mexican locations hoping to attract battery manufacturing investment may not have figured it out yet, but their competitive position versus the US took a major hit when Biden signed the IRA.)\nThat\u2019s why we recently got news of Tesla reportedly deciding to scrap some investments it had already made in Germany (but not all of them) and move some battery cell production stateside. That\u2019s why Tesla is reportedly exploring lithium refining in Texas now as well. That\u2019s why GM is reportedly accelerating its exploration of EV battery mineral supplies from US soil. \u201cOur thought process was that we would do this over a period of time, but with the IRA, we are actively working on figuring out how to accelerate,\u201d said Sham Kunjur, GM\u2019s executive director for EV raw materials. But this is only the beginning. These are just the leaks from early movers and leaky groups. Whether it\u2019s Tesla, GM, Volkswagen, Ford, Panasonic, SK Innovation, LG Energy Solution (previously known as LG Chem), Samsung SDI, Albemarle, Livent, Piedmont Lithium, Talon Metals, Lithium Americas, Pilbara Minerals, or others, corporate teams are looking at the IRA, having their lawyers look at it, and starting to look much more seriously at what production opportunities they can launch in the United States.\nLooking at the Actual IRA Language\nSection 45X of the IRA concerns \u201ccomponents produced and sold after December 31, 2022.\u201d Near the beginning, it states that \u201cany taxable year is an amount equal to the sum of the credit amounts determined under subsection (b) with respect to each eligible component.\u201d In other words, if you get a tax credit for one component of a battery (raw lithium, for example), you can also go and get a tax credit for another component or even later stage of the same component (the refined lithium, for example). The tax credits are for each major stage of the production process, and that means you can get them for various components of a battery and various stages of processing or putting together those components. You can get the following credits:\n10% of the cost of battery electrode active materials\n$35/kWh of battery cell capacity\n$10/kW of battery module capacity (or, for a battery module that does not use battery cells, $45/kWh)\n10% of the cost of producing a battery mineral.\nAlso, while there\u2019s a phaseout for some of these between 2030 and 2032, there is no phaseout at all for the critical mineral subsidies! That\u2019s long-term stability for a market that needs it.\nWhat Minerals & Battery Components Are Eligible?\nRegarding electrode active materials, those include \u201ccathode materials, anode materials, anode foils, and electrochemically active materials, including solvents, additives, and electrolyte salts that contribute to the electrochemical processes necessary for energy storage.\u201d\nApplicable critical minerals include aluminum/alumina, antimony/antimony trisulfide concentrate, barite/barium sulfate, beryllium/copper-beryllium master alloy, cerium/cerium oxide, cesium/cesium formate/cesium carbonate, chromium/ferrochromium, cobalt/cobalt sulfate, graphite/graphitic carbon, lithium/lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, manganese, nickel/nickel sulphate, and many others.\nNotably, at the end, it\u2019s noted that only production that takes place in the United States is eligible for these tax credits. This creates a \u201cUSA premium\u201d in the supply of raw materials to facilities that want to get the maximum benefit from 45X. Any manufacturer will be eligible for a 45X tax credit which covers the yearly cost of production if their facility is using raw material from the US. For most manufacturing, raw material cost is the most significant component of OPEX after labor and energy. So, Biden, Schumer, Manchin, and their aides have been very clever here: \u201cwant the maximum benefit, Buy American.\u201d\nSo, let\u2019s go back to the example of Tesla (or you can use Ford, GM, or some other company in this hypothetical if you prefer). Tesla could, theoretically, get a tax credit for mining lithium, get a tax credit for refining lithium, get a tax credit for mining nickel, get a tax credit for refining nickel, get a tax credit for producing battery anodes, get a tax credit for producing battery cells, and get a tax credit for producing battery modules. Of course, Tesla isn\u2019t going to do all those things. However, I think that helps to explain the potential here. Whereas Tesla won\u2019t do all those things itself, companies and investors will be pouring into the United States to do them, and some automakers will deepen their vertical integration in the battery space as well.\nAs a final note, and perhaps as a teaser for something we\u2019ll come back to, while the incentives from the IRA are attractive, so is the potential for pricing control over raw materials! Whether Ford, GM, or Tesla, having more secure, stable, predictable control over key raw material costs could go a long way in being competitive and financially sustainable in the coming decade. How much is that pricing control worth as we go from ~5% EV market share in the US auto industry to 50% or more?\n\nRussia may launch lithium production in the coming four years\nJune 17, 20XX-1\n| As said at the SPIEF Oleg Kazanov, Director of the All-Russian Institute of Mineral Resources (VIMS) under Federal Subsoil Resources Management Agency, Russia may start lithium mining based on the ore deposits in the Murmansk region in 3-4 years and become one of the world\u2019s five largest producers in eight years\u2019 time.  |  |\n\u201cRussia has a lithium resource base, which is 10% of the world\u2019s reserves and explored back in the 60s of the previous century. This is almost 4 million tons in 15 explored deposits. The first two objects in the Murmansk region will gain licensing and active subsoil use by the end of the current year. I think production might start there already in the next three or four years. Moreover, these are world-class deposits, both in terms of the lithium reserves and content,\u201d O. Kazanov said.\nAccording to him, now the demand for lithium is boosting in the world. Its driver is the battery industry. \u201cAlready in the next 10 years, we will see an increase from the current 100,000 tons of lithium consumption to about 700,000 tons. In total, 88 deposits of ore lithium will be launched in the world soon, but it is not enough to cover its entire global demand,\u201d the expert notes.\nMeanwhile, in Russia, a peculiar situation has developed in the lithium industry. The country has huge reserves of ore lithium reaching 10% of the world\u2019s. Besides, Russia discovered lithium reserves in solutions in the bottom waters of the oil and gas fields in the Angara-Lena region, but they have not been fully assessed yet. The lithium content in solutions is very high by the world standards, i.e., about 300 mg/l.\nThere are two large lithium processing plants in Russia the Krasnoyarsk chemical-metallurgical plant, which buy raw lithium from Chile, bring it up to battery quality and ship to Southeast Asia.\nAgainst the background of this situation, Federal Subsoil Resources Management Agency has recognized development of the lithium ore and brine reserves as a priority area.\nLithium ore mining technologies already exist; they scale well, especially considering increase of the demand for lithium and its price rise. \u201cI think already on ore lithium, in the prospect of the next eight years, we are going to be among the top five producers of this metal along with Chile, Argentina, China and Australia,\u201d O. Kazanov noted.\nThe next stage in the Russia\u2019s lithium industry development after the ore deposits have been commissioned will be application of the technologies for lithium production from solutions. In the world, this is the DLE technology mainly used for solutions at geothermal power plants. In Russia, lithium solutions are found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields. This water is somehow extracted from the subsoil and injected back into the reservoir to maintain pressure in an oil and gas well.\nThe engineering center created based on the Krasnoyarsk chemical-metallurgical plant and VIMS developed its own technologies for lithium extraction just during a year, and now they are tested under the laboratory conditions.\n\nBy Marcelo Azevedo, Magdalena Baczy\u0144ska, Ken Hoffman, and Aleksandra Krauze\nLithium is the driving force behind electric vehicles, but will supply keep pace with demand? New technologies and sources of supply can fill the gap. \nDespite expectations that lithium demand will rise from approximately 500,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2021 to some three million to four million metric tons in 2030, we believe that the lithium industry will be able to provide enough product to supply the burgeoning lithium-ion battery industry. Alongside increasing the conventional lithium supply, which is expected to expand by over 300 percent between 2021 and 2030, direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP) can be the driving forces behind the industry\u2019s ability to respond more swiftly to soaring demand. Although DLE and DLP technologies are still in their infancy and subject to volatility given the industry\u2019s \u201chockey stick\u201d 1 demand growth and lead times, they offer significant promise of increasing supply, reducing the industry\u2019s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) footprint, and lowering costs, with already announced capacity contributing to around 10 percent of the 2030 lithium supply, as well as to other less advanced projects in the pipeline.\nHowever, satisfying the demand for lithium will not be a trivial problem. Despite COVID-19\u2019s impact on the automotive sector, electric vehicle (EV) sales grew by around 50 percent in 2020 and doubled to approximately seven million units in 2021. At the same time, surging EV demand has seen lithium prices skyrocket by around 550 percent in a year: by the beginning of March 2022, the lithium carbonate price had passed $75,000 per metric ton and lithium hydroxide prices had exceeded $65,000 per metric ton (compared with a five-year average of around $14,500 per metric ton). \nLithium is needed to produce virtually all traction batteries currently used in EVs as well as consumer electronics. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are widely used in many other applications as well, from energy storage to air mobility. As battery content varies based on its active materials mix, and with new battery technologies entering the market, there are many uncertainties around how the battery market will affect future lithium demand. For example, a lithium metal anode, which boosts energy density in batteries, has nearly double the lithium requirements per kilowatt-hour compared with the current widely used mixes incorporating a graphite anode.\nSo, will there be enough lithium to cover the needs of a new electrified world? As discussed in our recent article, \u201cThe raw-materials challenge: How the metals and mining sector will be at the core of enabling the energy transition,\u201d arriving at a considered answer and understanding the entire supply-and-demand context will be crucial for every player along the value chain\u2014mining companies, refiners, battery manufacturers, and automotive OEMs.\nLithium demand factors\nOver the next decade, McKinsey forecasts continued growth of Li-ion batteries at an annual compound rate of approximately 30 percent. By 2030, EVs, along with energy-storage systems, e-bikes, electrification of tools, and other battery-intensive applications, could account for 4,000 to 4,500 gigawatt-hours of Li-ion demand.\n  \nNot long ago, in 2015, less than 30 percent of lithium demand was for batteries; the bulk of demand was split between ceramics and glasses (35 percent) and greases, metallurgical powders, polymers, and other industrial uses (35-plus percent). By 2030, batteries are expected to account for 95 percent of lithium demand, and total needs will grow annually by 25 to 26 percent to reach 3.3 million to 3.8 million metric tons LCE depending on the scenarios outlined in Exhibit 2. \n\n\nReuse and recycle\nA frequently asked question is whether L-ion batteries can be recycled. With expected battery lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles, and the possibility of extending EV battery life through use in the energy-storage sector, battery recycling is expected to increase during the current decade, but not to game-changing levels. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. By 2030, such secondary supply is expected to account for slightly more than 6 percent of total lithium production (Exhibit 7).\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n01/03/20XX\nDear Ferdinand\nI am back to you with the memo as you have requested. If you have any comment I can modify the memo still today. \nBACKGROUND\nThe goals of the European green deal and other climate change policies have underlined the strategic role plaied by batteries on reaching the environmental objectives. In fact, the batteries are necessary to boost the production of energy from renewable sources. \nThe political agreement at EU level on the battery regulation is an important step. However, lithium, a key batteries material which is at the core of the batteries production cycle, is interested by a series of issues. These issues may compromise the goal of the proposal which aims at safe, sustainble and competitive batteries.\nIn fact, from the adoption of the regulation by the Commission, the context is changed. Outside the EU, the US may become extremely attractive to establish lithium production cycles on their territory by means of the IRA. Within the EU, the possible upcoming decision of the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) about the risk for human health because of certain key lithium salts, may compromise our internal investments on lithium supply and refining. \nMAIN ISSUES\nLithium is a key component of batteries. The global lithium demand will increase enormously in the next decade, and the global offer of lithium might not keep up the speed of the demand. This situation might be particularly critical in the EU where the lithium demand will be higher than in the rest of the world and the lithium mining and production is nonexistent. \nNowadays, the EU depends on supply and refinement of Lithium from third countries. Opening lithium mines and establishing lithium refinement plants in Europe, as foreseen in the proposal, will reduce the dependency from the third countries.\nHowever, if ECHA will decide to classify some key lithium salts hazardous for human health, its is expected that there will be an increase in the costs for mining and producing lithium in Europe, with potential exodus of investors.\nIn addition, on the other side of the Athlantic, the IRA makes extremely attractive to base lithium mining and refinement in the US terriotry.\nWAY FORWARD\nIt is necessary to impement new measures in the batteries regulation to prevent troubles for the european market and update the regulation to the new context.\nFirstly, regarding the production chain of batteries, we need to align the attractiveness of the EU market to those determined in the US by means of the IRA. Therefore we must value the production made in the EU and grant an incentive for each major stage of the production process. \nSecondly, independently from the ECHA decision, we cannot exclude that in future additional risks for human health will arise in the batteries product chain. Therefore we need to integrate the batteries regulation with a system that values the production chains that respect the EU law in terms of protection of the human health and on the other hand hinders those production chains that do not comply with the requirements for human health established by the EU. \nIn the long run, we will be able also to count on lithium recycling and on the use of new technologies like Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) and Direct Lithium to production (DLP), and the use of materials alternative to lithium can be explored. However, we need to invest on EU reserach to make these paths much more concrete.\nBefore our internal meeting, I will reach our collegues in ECHA for an update on the potential ban for certain lithium salts (the decision was expected by the beginning of this year). In case the ECHA will ban key lithiums salts, a revision of the impact assessment for the batteries regulation is desirable, the feasibility of this has to be checked during the internal meeting.\nAGENDA\nI've kept the agenda very simple and focused on our main issues for the ISC consultations: \n1 - Opening;\n2 - The proposal in the new context;\n3 - Fine-tuning the proposal:\n- the new global context  and attractiveness of the EU market;\n- valuing protection of human health in the batteries production chain;\n4 - Next steps for the fine-tuning of the proposal;\n5 - Closing of the meeting.\nI am available to support you on introducing points 3 ad 4 in partiular.  \nLooking forward\nYOU\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}]}

The proposal aims to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery life cycle. The initiative is closely linked to the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the New Industrial Strategy. \nAt the end of last year, The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. For the first time the legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of a battery \u2013 from the supply chain of raw materials, over the production to reuse and recycling of batteries \u2013 and ensure that they are safe, sustainable, and competitive.\nAs you know, our unit has the lead on this important file and our DG intends to launch the formal interservice consultation over the coming weeks. Before this, our DG wants to organize an internal reflection and brainstorming meeting, and I have been appointed to chair this meeting.\nCould you produce an internal memo, summarizing the main ins and outs of this file and the agenda for the internal meeting with concrete proposals and recommendations to fine-tune the original proposal, in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators. \nI\u2019m on mission tomorrow so please could you get this done for me today. It doesn\u2019t need to be long \u2013 in fact the shorter, the better.  \n\nMany thanks\n\nCase Study Content: \n,\n\nFerdinand\nHead of Unit\n\n\n\n\nIs Europe Moving Fast Enough to Build a Resilient Lithium Supply Chain? \nPriscila Barrera\nNov. 16, 20XX-1\n\n\nEurope will soon release its Critical Raw Materials Act to identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk.\nEurope\u2019s green energy transition plans give a central role to the electrification of transportation. \nThe European Union (EU) has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Recently proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035.\nIn 20XX-2, electric car registrations for the year were close to 1,729,000, up from 1,061,000 in 2020, with prospects for the region remaining positive. Last year, the market share of battery electric cars almost doubled to around 10 percent, but challenges faced by carmakers continue to weigh on demand as inflation and fears of a recession put pressure on targets. \nIn its most recent forecast, the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA) said it expects the overall EU car market to shrink again this year, slipping by 1 percent to reach 9.6 million units.\n\u201cTo ensure a return to growth \u2014 with an even greater share of electric vehicle sales so climate targets can be met \u2014 we urgently need the right framework conditions to be put in place,\u201d said Oliver Zipse, ACEA president and CEO of BMW. \u201cThese include greater resilience in Europe\u2019s supply chains, an EU Critical Raw Materials Act that ensures strategic access to the raw materials needed for e-mobility, and an accelerated roll-out of charging infrastructure.\u201d\nAs sales of electric vehicles increase, carmakers are looking to secure supply of key metals used in batteries, including lithium. Today, Europe is quite dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply and China for lithium refining, but the region is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for the important battery metal. \nWhat is the European Critical Raw Materials Act? \nIn September, news broke that Europe will be putting forward the European Critical Raw Materials Act, a new piece of legislation. Its aim is to identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc has learned its lesson about the risks of being dependent on Russia, and realizes the need to be vigilant toward China.\n\"In the case of China, it is the risk of dependency on technologies and raw materials,\" she said, adding that the EU needs to boost its production capacity and shift more towards trustworthy suppliers.\nIn October, von der Leyen said the EU is witnessing quite an acceleration of trends and tensions with China. \n\"The Chinese system is fundamentally different from ours and we are aware of the nature of the rivalry,'' she said.\nThe moves from the EU are in line with pushes seen in other regions such as North America, where the US has committed billions of dollars to reach its carbon emissions targets.\nIn June, the Biden administration launched the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate incentives. The legislation, which was signed into law in August, requires automakers to source 50 percent of critical minerals used in electric vehicle batteries from North America or free trade agreement countries by 2024, with that amount rising to 80 percent by the end of 20XX+3.\nFor its part, Canada recently ordered three Chinese companies to divest from lithium companies following a \u201cmulti-step national security review process.\u201d China has opposed the move, and Canada is expected to release its China strategy soon.\nEurope-Asia relationship in the lithium space \nJack Bedder of Project Blue said Asia will always be a part of the European lithium-ion battery supply chain. Major Asian companies, including Panasonic, Samsung, BYD Company and CATL, all have operating capacity on the continent.\n\u201cAs a result, it will be almost impossible to detach fully from Chinese-owned supply across all stages of the lithium-ion supply chain,\u201d he told the Investing News Network.\nHowever, as lithium processing capacity is built up globally at non-Chinese-owned companies, particularly within the EU, the opportunities to reduce the EU's dependency on China-owned supply will improve. \u201cIt is very unlikely that the EU will implement legislation directly prohibiting lithium supply from Chinese-owned companies, as further constraints on supply availability to the European market will only hinder growth in the industry over the coming decade,\u201d Bedder added.\nFor Allan Pedersen of Wood Mackenzie, Europe cannot move forward without influence from Asia in the short to medium term.\nThat\u2019s due to a few reasons. As mentioned, many of the battery plants being constructed in Europe have Asian companies behind them, and the cathodes needed in batteries are still largely produced in Asia, where the know-how is strongest. Additionally, lithium refining is mainly done in China and most mineral concentrate is produced in Australia.\n\u201cChina has a multi-year advantage over the rest of the world in terms of investing in the entire supply chain \u2014 it will be challenging for Europe to catch up to that in terms of investment in know-how, processing equipment and resources,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that Europe cannot make progress in this space. In lithium, we see some resource developments and processing facilities being considered and constructed.\u201d\nFor the analyst, in the long-term Europe has the potential to become more self-sufficient for raw materials as recycling becomes a larger part of the supply landscape and can supplement domestic resources.\nEuropean Commission could classify lithium as toxic. \nAlthough Europe is pushing to build a resilient supply chain by partnering with allies and developing domestic resources, it might not all be good news for miners in the region \u2014 at the end of last year, the European Commission said it will weigh a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride and hydroxide as dangerous for human health.\nIf the proposal is approved, this could undermine the EU\u2019s attempt to create and support a domestic battery materials supply chain, research firm Rystad Energy said in a statement. \u201cThe EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium to supply its nascent electric vehicle production sector and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions, at a time when the union is focused on energy security and reducing emissions,\u201d the document reads.\nIf the classification goes ahead, it would not stop lithium usage, but it is highly likely to have an impact on at least four stages: lithium mining, processing, cathode production and recycling.\n\u201cThis potential ruling comes at a time when the EU is itself scrambling to build and establish local lithium supply chains. The permitting issue has repeatedly been highlighted at recent industry events as one of the main barriers to new mining projects ramping up quickly in the EU,\u201d according to Rystad Energy analysts. \u201cThere is also further risk of potential projects losing local community support for building lithium mines and processing operations.\u201d\nEditorial Disclosure: The Investing News Network does not guarantee the accuracy or thoroughness of the information reported in the interviews it conducts.

The European Chemicals Agency or ECHA initiated the process.\nThe European Union has been making its environmental and climate rules stricter for decades. The administration in Brussels wants to make the entire continent carbon neutral by mid-century. At the same time, it is striving to achieve the highest level of protection from pollution in the world.\nThe energy transition and the decarbonization of industrial activity and power plants imply massive deployment of renewables, mostly solar and wind farms. However, as they depend on unstable weather conditions, the electric power system requires energy storage, in which the EU counts a lot on batteries.\nDangerous critical raw material\nLithium-ion solutions still dominate the sector, though there are other technologies emerging that could popularize less harmful material for home units and the batteries for electronic devices, electric vehicles, and utility systems. At the same time, the European Commission is struggling to secure supply chains that would make the availability of lithium stable and make the EU almost self-sufficient by 20XX+7.\nThe European Union has added lithium to a list of critical raw materials as demand is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years.\nInitiatives to open mines and ore processing plants such as the ones in Serbia and Portugal have caused a public uproar as environmentalists and the local population are fearful about the impact on nature and people\u2019s livelihoods. In other projects, engineers are trying to make the extraction of lithium from geothermal waters cost effective and harmless, without any mining.\nStricter rules for handling lithium would lift costs\nHowever, the entire concept could falter with the European Commission\u2019s upcoming legislation. Namely, it is considering the proposal from the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA, to declare key lithium salts hazardous for human health, Reuters reported. If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, and handling of the materials.\nECHA\u2019s Risk Assessment Committee accepted the demand from France in September to classify lithium salts as damaging for fertility and unborn children and to declare the substances harmful for breastfed children.\nAdding lithium salts to the list of materials hazardous for health may prompt the revision of a range of projects in the industry.\nStricter rules mean higher costs, so any lithium ore processing plant project, like the one in the Jadar area in Serbia, would need to be given a second look regarding its environmental impact and feasibility.\nAlbemarle, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has indicated it may be forced to close its plant in Langelsheim in north Germany if the plan is accepted. In that case, Chief Financial Officer Scott Tozier said, the company wouldn\u2019t be able to import lithium chloride, its primary feedstock.\nThe unit\u2019s annual revenue is USD 500 million, and the plant has over 600 employees. Tozier warned a decision to declare lithium salts hazardous would prompt an exodus of EU producers including battery recyclers.\nThe decision is expected to be reached by early next year, the article adds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Really Big Battery Deal in the IRA That People Are Missing\nBy Zachary Shahan \u2013 Published September 23, 20XX-1\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, almost all the discussion has been around the consumer tax credit for buying an electric vehicle, including the interesting new battery aspects of that. That\u2019s a big topic, but there\u2019s a whole other battery angle separate from the consumer tax credit, and it\u2019s huge.\nThe short summary of the whole thing is that the IRA incentives for nearly every stage of battery production and the battery supply chain are very attractive, and since they stack on top of each other, the IRA is likely to stimulate a \u201cgold rush\u201d of sorts in battery mineral mining, battery mineral refining, battery cell production, battery recycling, and battery pack production in the United States. When you also consider that consumers will need to get batteries whose components don\u2019t come from China, and that come from North America eventually, then it\u2019s essentially a given that everyone in the industry now knows it should have battery mineral mining and refining as well as battery cell and pack production in North America.\n\nSK Innovation Georgia battery factory rendering, courtesy of SK Innovation.\nThe Current EV Battery Mineral Situation\nFirst, let\u2019s note where we\u2019re starting from. The USA currently mines and refines close to 0% of the minerals that go into EV battery packs. China, on the other hands, mines or refines the majority of all the big ones, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. Here\u2019s a chart on Chinese EV battery mineral domination:\n\nMoney, Money, Money\nLooking at the data, the idea that Joe Biden was going to stimulate a gold rush in the EV battery mineral mining and refining space was a dream some of us had, but it seemed like one of the more outlandish dreams we could have in this time and age. However, the market does respond to three things pretty well: money, money, money, and money. And the Biden administration, Prime Minister Manchin, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and others involved in crafting the legislation took note and decided to offer all four.\nThe slight joke here, aimed at emphasizing the key point, is that the IRA seems to be offering cash money (tax credits) for mining battery minerals, for refining battery minerals, for putting together battery cells, and for putting together battery packs (or \u201cmodules\u201d). If you do all those things, you don\u2019t get one bonus, you get four bonuses. If you count all the different minerals in a battery, the number of potential bonuses is much larger. Those bonuses add up, and they make it much more appealing to bring full-cycle battery production to the USA. At the very least, it should open mining and refining projects \u2014 which are more or less non-existent in the United States \u2014 by making them much more bankable. (Side note: Canadian and Mexican locations hoping to attract battery manufacturing investment may not have figured it out yet, but their competitive position versus the US took a major hit when Biden signed the IRA.)\nThat\u2019s why we recently got news of Tesla reportedly deciding to scrap some investments it had already made in Germany (but not all of them) and move some battery cell production stateside. That\u2019s why Tesla is reportedly exploring lithium refining in Texas now as well. That\u2019s why GM is reportedly accelerating its exploration of EV battery mineral supplies from US soil. \u201cOur thought process was that we would do this over a period of time, but with the IRA, we are actively working on figuring out how to accelerate,\u201d said Sham Kunjur, GM\u2019s executive director for EV raw materials. But this is only the beginning. These are just the leaks from early movers and leaky groups. Whether it\u2019s Tesla, GM, Volkswagen, Ford, Panasonic, SK Innovation, LG Energy Solution (previously known as LG Chem), Samsung SDI, Albemarle, Livent, Piedmont Lithium, Talon Metals, Lithium Americas, Pilbara Minerals, or others, corporate teams are looking at the IRA, having their lawyers look at it, and starting to look much more seriously at what production opportunities they can launch in the United States.\nLooking at the Actual IRA Language\nSection 45X of the IRA concerns \u201ccomponents produced and sold after December 31, 2022.\u201d Near the beginning, it states that \u201cany taxable year is an amount equal to the sum of the credit amounts determined under subsection (b) with respect to each eligible component.\u201d In other words, if you get a tax credit for one component of a battery (raw lithium, for example), you can also go and get a tax credit for another component or even later stage of the same component (the refined lithium, for example). The tax credits are for each major stage of the production process, and that means you can get them for various components of a battery and various stages of processing or putting together those components. You can get the following credits:\n10% of the cost of battery electrode active materials\n$35/kWh of battery cell capacity\n$10/kW of battery module capacity (or, for a battery module that does not use battery cells, $45/kWh)\n10% of the cost of producing a battery mineral.\nAlso, while there\u2019s a phaseout for some of these between 2030 and 2032, there is no phaseout at all for the critical mineral subsidies! That\u2019s long-term stability for a market that needs it.\nWhat Minerals & Battery Components Are Eligible?\nRegarding electrode active materials, those include \u201ccathode materials, anode materials, anode foils, and electrochemically active materials, including solvents, additives, and electrolyte salts that contribute to the electrochemical processes necessary for energy storage.\u201d\nApplicable critical minerals include aluminum/alumina, antimony/antimony trisulfide concentrate, barite/barium sulfate, beryllium/copper-beryllium master alloy, cerium/cerium oxide, cesium/cesium formate/cesium carbonate, chromium/ferrochromium, cobalt/cobalt sulfate, graphite/graphitic carbon, lithium/lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, manganese, nickel/nickel sulphate, and many others.\nNotably, at the end, it\u2019s noted that only production that takes place in the United States is eligible for these tax credits. This creates a \u201cUSA premium\u201d in the supply of raw materials to facilities that want to get the maximum benefit from 45X. Any manufacturer will be eligible for a 45X tax credit which covers the yearly cost of production if their facility is using raw material from the US. For most manufacturing, raw material cost is the most significant component of OPEX after labor and energy. So, Biden, Schumer, Manchin, and their aides have been very clever here: \u201cwant the maximum benefit, Buy American.\u201d\nSo, let\u2019s go back to the example of Tesla (or you can use Ford, GM, or some other company in this hypothetical if you prefer). Tesla could, theoretically, get a tax credit for mining lithium, get a tax credit for refining lithium, get a tax credit for mining nickel, get a tax credit for refining nickel, get a tax credit for producing battery anodes, get a tax credit for producing battery cells, and get a tax credit for producing battery modules. Of course, Tesla isn\u2019t going to do all those things. However, I think that helps to explain the potential here. Whereas Tesla won\u2019t do all those things itself, companies and investors will be pouring into the United States to do them, and some automakers will deepen their vertical integration in the battery space as well.\nAs a final note, and perhaps as a teaser for something we\u2019ll come back to, while the incentives from the IRA are attractive, so is the potential for pricing control over raw materials! Whether Ford, GM, or Tesla, having more secure, stable, predictable control over key raw material costs could go a long way in being competitive and financially sustainable in the coming decade. How much is that pricing control worth as we go from ~5% EV market share in the US auto industry to 50% or more?\n\nRussia may launch lithium production in the coming four years\nJune 17, 20XX-1\n| As said at the SPIEF Oleg Kazanov, Director of the All-Russian Institute of Mineral Resources (VIMS) under Federal Subsoil Resources Management Agency, Russia may start lithium mining based on the ore deposits in the Murmansk region in 3-4 years and become one of the world\u2019s five largest producers in eight years\u2019 time.  |  |\n\u201cRussia has a lithium resource base, which is 10% of the world\u2019s reserves and explored back in the 60s of the previous century. This is almost 4 million tons in 15 explored deposits. The first two objects in the Murmansk region will gain licensing and active subsoil use by the end of the current year. I think production might start there already in the next three or four years. Moreover, these are world-class deposits, both in terms of the lithium reserves and content,\u201d O. Kazanov said.\nAccording to him, now the demand for lithium is boosting in the world. Its driver is the battery industry. \u201cAlready in the next 10 years, we will see an increase from the current 100,000 tons of lithium consumption to about 700,000 tons. In total, 88 deposits of ore lithium will be launched in the world soon, but it is not enough to cover its entire global demand,\u201d the expert notes.\nMeanwhile, in Russia, a peculiar situation has developed in the lithium industry. The country has huge reserves of ore lithium reaching 10% of the world\u2019s. Besides, Russia discovered lithium reserves in solutions in the bottom waters of the oil and gas fields in the Angara-Lena region, but they have not been fully assessed yet. The lithium content in solutions is very high by the world standards, i.e., about 300 mg/l.\nThere are two large lithium processing plants in Russia the Krasnoyarsk chemical-metallurgical plant, which buy raw lithium from Chile, bring it up to battery quality and ship to Southeast Asia.\nAgainst the background of this situation, Federal Subsoil Resources Management Agency has recognized development of the lithium ore and brine reserves as a priority area.\nLithium ore mining technologies already exist; they scale well, especially considering increase of the demand for lithium and its price rise. \u201cI think already on ore lithium, in the prospect of the next eight years, we are going to be among the top five producers of this metal along with Chile, Argentina, China and Australia,\u201d O. Kazanov noted.\nThe next stage in the Russia\u2019s lithium industry development after the ore deposits have been commissioned will be application of the technologies for lithium production from solutions. In the world, this is the DLE technology mainly used for solutions at geothermal power plants. In Russia, lithium solutions are found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields. This water is somehow extracted from the subsoil and injected back into the reservoir to maintain pressure in an oil and gas well.\nThe engineering center created based on the Krasnoyarsk chemical-metallurgical plant and VIMS developed its own technologies for lithium extraction just during a year, and now they are tested under the laboratory conditions.\n\nBy Marcelo Azevedo, Magdalena Baczy\u0144ska, Ken Hoffman, and Aleksandra Krauze\nLithium is the driving force behind electric vehicles, but will supply keep pace with demand? New technologies and sources of supply can fill the gap. \nDespite expectations that lithium demand will rise from approximately 500,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2021 to some three million to four million metric tons in 2030, we believe that the lithium industry will be able to provide enough product to supply the burgeoning lithium-ion battery industry. Alongside increasing the conventional lithium supply, which is expected to expand by over 300 percent between 2021 and 2030, direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP) can be the driving forces behind the industry\u2019s ability to respond more swiftly to soaring demand. Although DLE and DLP technologies are still in their infancy and subject to volatility given the industry\u2019s \u201chockey stick\u201d 1 demand growth and lead times, they offer significant promise of increasing supply, reducing the industry\u2019s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) footprint, and lowering costs, with already announced capacity contributing to around 10 percent of the 2030 lithium supply, as well as to other less advanced projects in the pipeline.\nHowever, satisfying the demand for lithium will not be a trivial problem. Despite COVID-19\u2019s impact on the automotive sector, electric vehicle (EV) sales grew by around 50 percent in 2020 and doubled to approximately seven million units in 2021. At the same time, surging EV demand has seen lithium prices skyrocket by around 550 percent in a year: by the beginning of March 2022, the lithium carbonate price had passed $75,000 per metric ton and lithium hydroxide prices had exceeded $65,000 per metric ton (compared with a five-year average of around $14,500 per metric ton). \nLithium is needed to produce virtually all traction batteries currently used in EVs as well as consumer electronics. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are widely used in many other applications as well, from energy storage to air mobility. As battery content varies based on its active materials mix, and with new battery technologies entering the market, there are many uncertainties around how the battery market will affect future lithium demand. For example, a lithium metal anode, which boosts energy density in batteries, has nearly double the lithium requirements per kilowatt-hour compared with the current widely used mixes incorporating a graphite anode.\nSo, will there be enough lithium to cover the needs of a new electrified world? As discussed in our recent article, \u201cThe raw-materials challenge: How the metals and mining sector will be at the core of enabling the energy transition,\u201d arriving at a considered answer and understanding the entire supply-and-demand context will be crucial for every player along the value chain\u2014mining companies, refiners, battery manufacturers, and automotive OEMs.\nLithium demand factors\nOver the next decade, McKinsey forecasts continued growth of Li-ion batteries at an annual compound rate of approximately 30 percent. By 2030, EVs, along with energy-storage systems, e-bikes, electrification of tools, and other battery-intensive applications, could account for 4,000 to 4,500 gigawatt-hours of Li-ion demand.\n  \nNot long ago, in 2015, less than 30 percent of lithium demand was for batteries; the bulk of demand was split between ceramics and glasses (35 percent) and greases, metallurgical powders, polymers, and other industrial uses (35-plus percent). By 2030, batteries are expected to account for 95 percent of lithium demand, and total needs will grow annually by 25 to 26 percent to reach 3.3 million to 3.8 million metric tons LCE depending on the scenarios outlined in Exhibit 2. \n\n\nReuse and recycle\nA frequently asked question is whether L-ion batteries can be recycled. With expected battery lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles, and the possibility of extending EV battery life through use in the energy-storage sector, battery recycling is expected to increase during the current decade, but not to game-changing levels. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. By 2030, such secondary supply is expected to account for slightly more than 6 percent of total lithium production (Exhibit 7).\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nIn the light of the upcoming surge of the demand of electric vehicles (EV), an even greater increase is expected in the industry of EV batteries and especially in the demand of lithium, which is a key chemical component of them. Demand is expected to increase by 500% until 2030, affecting its price accordingly, forcing EU to be dependable on imports due to the fact that no lithium processing or refining takes place within its territory.\nEU's intention to fully detach from Chinese-owned supply across all stages of the lithium-ion supply chain may prove impossible but it is expected to improve in the next decades. Thus, directly prohibiting supplies from Chinese-owned companies is not advisable due to the fact that China has a multi-year advantage over the rest of the world in terms of investment, know-how, processing equipment and resources.\nYet, it is imperative that the EU should take measures in order to remain competitive in the approximate future. Considering that the other main players, such us the USA, Russia and Canada have already started implementing policies aiming to decrease their dependancy for EV battery components from China or boost their own industries, EU has to take action. Specifically, the EU could examine strategies such as:\n- Subsidise companies in the industry of lithium extraction and processing that could possibly use new technologies (more efficient or enviroment friendly) to extract the mineral. Technologies such as DLE and DLP may prove a good investment in order for the EU to match the demand of lithium in the near future.\n- Incentivise companies that are already active in similar industries to invest in lithium extraction and processing as well or to examine whether some of their byproducts can be refined to be used as EV battery components.\n- Offer tax credits for companies in the lithium industry, as a countermeasure to the US IRA.\n- Negotiatie long term trade agreements with main producers such as Australia, Chile or Argentina as an attempt to control prices of imported lithium and thus retain a competitve advantage for its companies.\n Additionally, and in order to avoid a gradual exit of big EV manufacturers from EU, classifying lithium derivatives as dangerous will complicate the import procedure, production and handling of the materials, further increasing costs. In order to deal with the ECHA proposal concerning the toxicity of certain lithium salts, the EU could incentivise companies to adopt controls that will ensure that said chemicals are not hazardous for the public health.\n In conclusion, the sharply increasing trend in demand and consequently in prices of EV battery components will force the EU to implement specific measures in order to remain competitive. It has to regulate lithium imports in order to control the price, decrease dependancy from China and boost its own industry since EVs are a crucial factor when it comes to the transition to a greener economy.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}]}

The proposal aims to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery life cycle. The initiative is closely linked to the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the New Industrial Strategy. \nAt the end of last year, The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. For the first time the legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of a battery \u2013 from the supply chain of raw materials, over the production to reuse and recycling of batteries \u2013 and ensure that they are safe, sustainable, and competitive.\nAs you know, our unit has the lead on this important file and our DG intends to launch the formal interservice consultation over the coming weeks. Before this, our DG wants to organize an internal reflection and brainstorming meeting, and I have been appointed to chair this meeting.\nCould you produce an internal memo, summarizing the main ins and outs of this file and the agenda for the internal meeting with concrete proposals and recommendations to fine-tune the original proposal, in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators. \nI\u2019m on mission tomorrow so please could you get this done for me today.

Recently proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035.\nIn 20XX-2, electric car registrations for the year were close to 1,729,000, up from 1,061,000 in 2020, with prospects for the region remaining positive. Last year, the market share of battery electric cars almost doubled to around 10 percent, but challenges faced by carmakers continue to weigh on demand as inflation and fears of a recession put pressure on targets. \nIn its most recent forecast, the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA) said it expects the overall EU car market to shrink again this year, slipping by 1 percent to reach 9.6 million units.\n\u201cTo ensure a return to growth \u2014 with an even greater share of electric vehicle sales so climate targets can be met \u2014 we urgently need the right framework conditions to be put in place,\u201d said Oliver Zipse, ACEA president and CEO of BMW. \u201cThese include greater resilience in Europe\u2019s supply chains, an EU Critical Raw Materials Act that ensures strategic access to the raw materials needed for e-mobility, and an accelerated roll-out of charging infrastructure.\u201d\nAs sales of electric vehicles increase, carmakers are looking to secure supply of key metals used in batteries, including lithium. Today, Europe is quite dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply and China for lithium refining, but the region is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for the important battery metal. \nWhat is the European Critical Raw Materials Act? \nIn September, news broke that Europe will be putting forward the European Critical Raw Materials Act, a new piece of legislation. Its aim is to identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc has learned its lesson about the risks of being dependent on Russia, and realizes the need to be vigilant toward China.\n\"In the case of China, it is the risk of dependency on technologies and raw materials,\" she said, adding that the EU needs to boost its production capacity and shift more towards trustworthy suppliers.\nIn October, von der Leyen said the EU is witnessing quite an acceleration of trends and tensions with China. \n\"The Chinese system is fundamentally different from ours and we are aware of the nature of the rivalry,'' she said.\nThe moves from the EU are in line with pushes seen in other regions such as North America, where the US has committed billions of dollars to reach its carbon emissions targets.\nIn June, the Biden administration launched the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate incentives. The legislation, which was signed into law in August, requires automakers to source 50 percent of critical minerals used in electric vehicle batteries from North America or free trade agreement countries by 2024, with that amount rising to 80 percent by the end of 20XX+3.\nFor its part, Canada recently ordered three Chinese companies to divest from lithium companies following a \u201cmulti-step national security review process.\u201d China has opposed the move, and Canada is expected to release its China strategy soon.\nEurope-Asia relationship in the lithium space \nJack Bedder of Project Blue said Asia will always be a part of the European lithium-ion battery supply chain. Major Asian companies, including Panasonic, Samsung, BYD Company and CATL, all have operating capacity on the continent.\n\u201cAs a result, it will be almost impossible to detach fully from Chinese-owned supply across all stages of the lithium-ion supply chain,\u201d he told the Investing News Network.\nHowever, as lithium processing capacity is built up globally at non-Chinese-owned companies, particularly within the EU, the opportunities to reduce the EU's dependency on China-owned supply will improve. \u201cIt is very unlikely that the EU will implement legislation directly prohibiting lithium supply from Chinese-owned companies, as further constraints on supply availability to the European market will only hinder growth in the industry over the coming decade,\u201d Bedder added.\nFor Allan Pedersen of Wood Mackenzie, Europe cannot move forward without influence from Asia in the short to medium term.\nThat\u2019s due to a few reasons. As mentioned, many of the battery plants being constructed in Europe have Asian companies behind them, and the cathodes needed in batteries are still largely produced in Asia, where the know-how is strongest. Additionally, lithium refining is mainly done in China and most mineral concentrate is produced in Australia.\n\u201cChina has a multi-year advantage over the rest of the world in terms of investing in the entire supply chain \u2014 it will be challenging for Europe to catch up to that in terms of investment in know-how, processing equipment and resources,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that Europe cannot make progress in this space. In lithium, we see some resource developments and processing facilities being considered and constructed.\u201d\nFor the analyst, in the long-term Europe has the potential to become more self-sufficient for raw materials as recycling becomes a larger part of the supply landscape and can supplement domestic resources.\nEuropean Commission could classify lithium as toxic. \nAlthough Europe is pushing to build a resilient supply chain by partnering with allies and developing domestic resources, it might not all be good news for miners in the region \u2014 at the end of last year, the European Commission said it will weigh a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride and hydroxide as dangerous for human health.\nIf the proposal is approved, this could undermine the EU\u2019s attempt to create and support a domestic battery materials supply chain, research firm Rystad Energy said in a statement. \u201cThe EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium to supply its nascent electric vehicle production sector and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions, at a time when the union is focused on energy security and reducing emissions,\u201d the document reads.\nIf the classification goes ahead, it would not stop lithium usage, but it is highly likely to have an impact on at least four stages: lithium mining, processing, cathode production and recycling.\n\u201cThis potential ruling comes at a time when the EU is itself scrambling to build and establish local lithium supply chains. The permitting issue has repeatedly been highlighted at recent industry events as one of the main barriers to new mining projects ramping up quickly in the EU,\u201d according to Rystad Energy analysts. \u201cThere is also further risk of potential projects losing local community support for building lithium mines and processing operations.\u201d\nEditorial Disclosure: The Investing News Network does not guarantee the accuracy or thoroughness of the information reported in the interviews it conducts.

The European Chemicals Agency or ECHA initiated the process.\nThe European Union has been making its environmental and climate rules stricter for decades. The administration in Brussels wants to make the entire continent carbon neutral by mid-century. At the same time, it is striving to achieve the highest level of protection from pollution in the world.\nThe energy transition and the decarbonization of industrial activity and power plants imply massive deployment of renewables, mostly solar and wind farms. However, as they depend on unstable weather conditions, the electric power system requires energy storage, in which the EU counts a lot on batteries.\nDangerous critical raw material\nLithium-ion solutions still dominate the sector, though there are other technologies emerging that could popularize less harmful material for home units and the batteries for electronic devices, electric vehicles, and utility systems. At the same time, the European Commission is struggling to secure supply chains that would make the availability of lithium stable and make the EU almost self-sufficient by 20XX+7.\nThe European Union has added lithium to a list of critical raw materials as demand is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years.\nInitiatives to open mines and ore processing plants such as the ones in Serbia and Portugal have caused a public uproar as environmentalists and the local population are fearful about the impact on nature and people\u2019s livelihoods. In other projects, engineers are trying to make the extraction of lithium from geothermal waters cost effective and harmless, without any mining.\nStricter rules for handling lithium would lift costs\nHowever, the entire concept could falter with the European Commission\u2019s upcoming legislation. Namely, it is considering the proposal from the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA, to declare key lithium salts hazardous for human health, Reuters reported. If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, and handling of the materials.\nECHA\u2019s Risk Assessment Committee accepted the demand from France in September to classify lithium salts as damaging for fertility and unborn children and to declare the substances harmful for breastfed children.\nAdding lithium salts to the list of materials hazardous for health may prompt the revision of a range of projects in the industry.\nStricter rules mean higher costs, so any lithium ore processing plant project, like the one in the Jadar area in Serbia, would need to be given a second look regarding its environmental impact and feasibility.\nAlbemarle, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has indicated it may be forced to close its plant in Langelsheim in north Germany if the plan is accepted. In that case, Chief Financial Officer Scott Tozier said, the company wouldn\u2019t be able to import lithium chloride, its primary feedstock.\nThe unit\u2019s annual revenue is USD 500 million, and the plant has over 600 employees. Tozier warned a decision to declare lithium salts hazardous would prompt an exodus of EU producers including battery recyclers.\nThe decision is expected to be reached by early next year, the article adds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Really Big Battery Deal in the IRA That People Are Missing\nBy Zachary Shahan \u2013 Published September 23, 20XX-1\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, almost all the discussion has been around the consumer tax credit for buying an electric vehicle, including the interesting new battery aspects of that. That\u2019s a big topic, but there\u2019s a whole other battery angle separate from the consumer tax credit, and it\u2019s huge.\nThe short summary of the whole thing is that the IRA incentives for nearly every stage of battery production and the battery supply chain are very attractive, and since they stack on top of each other, the IRA is likely to stimulate a \u201cgold rush\u201d of sorts in battery mineral mining, battery mineral refining, battery cell production, battery recycling, and battery pack production in the United States. When you also consider that consumers will need to get batteries whose components don\u2019t come from China, and that come from North America eventually, then it\u2019s essentially a given that everyone in the industry now knows it should have battery mineral mining and refining as well as battery cell and pack production in North America.\n\nSK Innovation Georgia battery factory rendering, courtesy of SK Innovation.\nThe Current EV Battery Mineral Situation\nFirst, let\u2019s note where we\u2019re starting from. The USA currently mines and refines close to 0% of the minerals that go into EV battery packs. China, on the other hands, mines or refines the majority of all the big ones, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. Here\u2019s a chart on Chinese EV battery mineral domination:\n\nMoney, Money, Money\nLooking at the data, the idea that Joe Biden was going to stimulate a gold rush in the EV battery mineral mining and refining space was a dream some of us had, but it seemed like one of the more outlandish dreams we could have in this time and age. However, the market does respond to three things pretty well: money, money, money, and money. And the Biden administration, Prime Minister Manchin, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and others involved in crafting the legislation took note and decided to offer all four.\nThe slight joke here, aimed at emphasizing the key point, is that the IRA seems to be offering cash money (tax credits) for mining battery minerals, for refining battery minerals, for putting together battery cells, and for putting together battery packs (or \u201cmodules\u201d). If you do all those things, you don\u2019t get one bonus, you get four bonuses. If you count all the different minerals in a battery, the number of potential bonuses is much larger. Those bonuses add up, and they make it much more appealing to bring full-cycle battery production to the USA. At the very least, it should open mining and refining projects \u2014 which are more or less non-existent in the United States \u2014 by making them much more bankable. (Side note: Canadian and Mexican locations hoping to attract battery manufacturing investment may not have figured it out yet, but their competitive position versus the US took a major hit when Biden signed the IRA.)\nThat\u2019s why we recently got news of Tesla reportedly deciding to scrap some investments it had already made in Germany (but not all of them) and move some battery cell production stateside. That\u2019s why Tesla is reportedly exploring lithium refining in Texas now as well. That\u2019s why GM is reportedly accelerating its exploration of EV battery mineral supplies from US soil. \u201cOur thought process was that we would do this over a period of time, but with the IRA, we are actively working on figuring out how to accelerate,\u201d said Sham Kunjur, GM\u2019s executive director for EV raw materials. But this is only the beginning. These are just the leaks from early movers and leaky groups. Whether it\u2019s Tesla, GM, Volkswagen, Ford, Panasonic, SK Innovation, LG Energy Solution (previously known as LG Chem), Samsung SDI, Albemarle, Livent, Piedmont Lithium, Talon Metals, Lithium Americas, Pilbara Minerals, or others, corporate teams are looking at the IRA, having their lawyers look at it, and starting to look much more seriously at what production opportunities they can launch in the United States.\nLooking at the Actual IRA Language\nSection 45X of the IRA concerns \u201ccomponents produced and sold after December 31, 2022.\u201d Near the beginning, it states that \u201cany taxable year is an amount equal to the sum of the credit amounts determined under subsection (b) with respect to each eligible component.\u201d In other words, if you get a tax credit for one component of a battery (raw lithium, for example), you can also go and get a tax credit for another component or even later stage of the same component (the refined lithium, for example). The tax credits are for each major stage of the production process, and that means you can get them for various components of a battery and various stages of processing or putting together those components. You can get the following credits:\n10% of the cost of battery electrode active materials\n$35/kWh of battery cell capacity\n$10/kW of battery module capacity (or, for a battery module that does not use battery cells, $45/kWh)\n10% of the cost of producing a battery mineral.\nAlso, while there\u2019s a phaseout for some of these between 2030 and 2032, there is no phaseout at all for the critical mineral subsidies! That\u2019s long-term stability for a market that needs it.\nWhat Minerals & Battery Components Are Eligible?\nRegarding electrode active materials, those include \u201ccathode materials, anode materials, anode foils, and electrochemically active materials, including solvents, additives, and electrolyte salts that contribute to the electrochemical processes necessary for energy storage.\u201d\nApplicable critical minerals include aluminum/alumina, antimony/antimony trisulfide concentrate, barite/barium sulfate, beryllium/copper-beryllium master alloy, cerium/cerium oxide, cesium/cesium formate/cesium carbonate, chromium/ferrochromium, cobalt/cobalt sulfate, graphite/graphitic carbon, lithium/lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, manganese, nickel/nickel sulphate, and many others.\nNotably, at the end, it\u2019s noted that only production that takes place in the United States is eligible for these tax credits. This creates a \u201cUSA premium\u201d in the supply of raw materials to facilities that want to get the maximum benefit from 45X. Any manufacturer will be eligible for a 45X tax credit which covers the yearly cost of production if their facility is using raw material from the US. For most manufacturing, raw material cost is the most significant component of OPEX after labor and energy. So, Biden, Schumer, Manchin, and their aides have been very clever here: \u201cwant the maximum benefit, Buy American.\u201d\nSo, let\u2019s go back to the example of Tesla (or you can use Ford, GM, or some other company in this hypothetical if you prefer). Tesla could, theoretically, get a tax credit for mining lithium, get a tax credit for refining lithium, get a tax credit for mining nickel, get a tax credit for refining nickel, get a tax credit for producing battery anodes, get a tax credit for producing battery cells, and get a tax credit for producing battery modules. Of course, Tesla isn\u2019t going to do all those things. However, I think that helps to explain the potential here. Whereas Tesla won\u2019t do all those things itself, companies and investors will be pouring into the United States to do them, and some automakers will deepen their vertical integration in the battery space as well.\nAs a final note, and perhaps as a teaser for something we\u2019ll come back to, while the incentives from the IRA are attractive, so is the potential for pricing control over raw materials! Whether Ford, GM, or Tesla, having more secure, stable, predictable control over key raw material costs could go a long way in being competitive and financially sustainable in the coming decade. How much is that pricing control worth as we go from ~5% EV market share in the US auto industry to 50% or more?\n\nRussia may launch lithium production in the coming four years\nJune 17, 20XX-1\n| As said at the SPIEF Oleg Kazanov, Director of the All-Russian Institute of Mineral Resources (VIMS) under Federal Subsoil Resources Management Agency, Russia may start lithium mining based on the ore deposits in the Murmansk region in 3-4 years and become one of the world\u2019s five largest producers in eight years\u2019 time.  |  |\n\u201cRussia has a lithium resource base, which is 10% of the world\u2019s reserves and explored back in the 60s of the previous century. This is almost 4 million tons in 15 explored deposits. The first two objects in the Murmansk region will gain licensing and active subsoil use by the end of the current year. I think production might start there already in the next three or four years. Moreover, these are world-class deposits, both in terms of the lithium reserves and content,\u201d O. Kazanov said.\nAccording to him, now the demand for lithium is boosting in the world. Its driver is the battery industry. \u201cAlready in the next 10 years, we will see an increase from the current 100,000 tons of lithium consumption to about 700,000 tons. In total, 88 deposits of ore lithium will be launched in the world soon, but it is not enough to cover its entire global demand,\u201d the expert notes.\nMeanwhile, in Russia, a peculiar situation has developed in the lithium industry. The country has huge reserves of ore lithium reaching 10% of the world\u2019s. Besides, Russia discovered lithium reserves in solutions in the bottom waters of the oil and gas fields in the Angara-Lena region, but they have not been fully assessed yet. The lithium content in solutions is very high by the world standards, i.e., about 300 mg/l.\nThere are two large lithium processing plants in Russia the Krasnoyarsk chemical-metallurgical plant, which buy raw lithium from Chile, bring it up to battery quality and ship to Southeast Asia.\nAgainst the background of this situation, Federal Subsoil Resources Management Agency has recognized development of the lithium ore and brine reserves as a priority area.\nLithium ore mining technologies already exist; they scale well, especially considering increase of the demand for lithium and its price rise. \u201cI think already on ore lithium, in the prospect of the next eight years, we are going to be among the top five producers of this metal along with Chile, Argentina, China and Australia,\u201d O. Kazanov noted.\nThe next stage in the Russia\u2019s lithium industry development after the ore deposits have been commissioned will be application of the technologies for lithium production from solutions. In the world, this is the DLE technology mainly used for solutions at geothermal power plants. In Russia, lithium solutions are found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields. This water is somehow extracted from the subsoil and injected back into the reservoir to maintain pressure in an oil and gas well.\nThe engineering center created based on the Krasnoyarsk chemical-metallurgical plant and VIMS developed its own technologies for lithium extraction just during a year, and now they are tested under the laboratory conditions.\n\nBy Marcelo Azevedo, Magdalena Baczy\u0144ska, Ken Hoffman, and Aleksandra Krauze\nLithium is the driving force behind electric vehicles, but will supply keep pace with demand? New technologies and sources of supply can fill the gap. \nDespite expectations that lithium demand will rise from approximately 500,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2021 to some three million to four million metric tons in 2030, we believe that the lithium industry will be able to provide enough product to supply the burgeoning lithium-ion battery industry. Alongside increasing the conventional lithium supply, which is expected to expand by over 300 percent between 2021 and 2030, direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP) can be the driving forces behind the industry\u2019s ability to respond more swiftly to soaring demand. Although DLE and DLP technologies are still in their infancy and subject to volatility given the industry\u2019s \u201chockey stick\u201d 1 demand growth and lead times, they offer significant promise of increasing supply, reducing the industry\u2019s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) footprint, and lowering costs, with already announced capacity contributing to around 10 percent of the 2030 lithium supply, as well as to other less advanced projects in the pipeline.\nHowever, satisfying the demand for lithium will not be a trivial problem. Despite COVID-19\u2019s impact on the automotive sector, electric vehicle (EV) sales grew by around 50 percent in 2020 and doubled to approximately seven million units in 2021. At the same time, surging EV demand has seen lithium prices skyrocket by around 550 percent in a year: by the beginning of March 2022, the lithium carbonate price had passed $75,000 per metric ton and lithium hydroxide prices had exceeded $65,000 per metric ton (compared with a five-year average of around $14,500 per metric ton). \nLithium is needed to produce virtually all traction batteries currently used in EVs as well as consumer electronics. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are widely used in many other applications as well, from energy storage to air mobility. As battery content varies based on its active materials mix, and with new battery technologies entering the market, there are many uncertainties around how the battery market will affect future lithium demand. For example, a lithium metal anode, which boosts energy density in batteries, has nearly double the lithium requirements per kilowatt-hour compared with the current widely used mixes incorporating a graphite anode.\nSo, will there be enough lithium to cover the needs of a new electrified world? As discussed in our recent article, \u201cThe raw-materials challenge: How the metals and mining sector will be at the core of enabling the energy transition,\u201d arriving at a considered answer and understanding the entire supply-and-demand context will be crucial for every player along the value chain\u2014mining companies, refiners, battery manufacturers, and automotive OEMs.\nLithium demand factors\nOver the next decade, McKinsey forecasts continued growth of Li-ion batteries at an annual compound rate of approximately 30 percent. By 2030, EVs, along with energy-storage systems, e-bikes, electrification of tools, and other battery-intensive applications, could account for 4,000 to 4,500 gigawatt-hours of Li-ion demand.\n  \nNot long ago, in 2015, less than 30 percent of lithium demand was for batteries; the bulk of demand was split between ceramics and glasses (35 percent) and greases, metallurgical powders, polymers, and other industrial uses (35-plus percent). By 2030, batteries are expected to account for 95 percent of lithium demand, and total needs will grow annually by 25 to 26 percent to reach 3.3 million to 3.8 million metric tons LCE depending on the scenarios outlined in Exhibit 2. \n\n\nReuse and recycle\nA frequently asked question is whether L-ion batteries can be recycled. With expected battery lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles, and the possibility of extending EV battery life through use in the energy-storage sector, battery recycling is expected to increase during the current decade, but not to game-changing levels. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. By 2030, such secondary supply is expected to account for slightly more than 6 percent of total lithium production (Exhibit 7).\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nFor: Ferdinand Porsche (HoU DG MOVE)\n01/03/2023\nINTERNAL MEETING MEMO on sustainable, circular, European battery supply chain\nFACTS\nEU legislation is to ban combustion engine cars by 2035, plan with net-zero economy, climate neutral by 2050.\nImpossible to detach fuly from Chinese lithium-ion supply, but as the lithium processing companies are mostly EU-based dependency on China will improve. Lithium refining done mostly in China, cathodes produced there as well, mineral concentrate in Australia. China has years of advancement of supply chain and know how in the field.\nOutlook on less China dependency is thus more long term and legislation against China is therefore not likely to not hamper EU market development. EU has real potential to become self sufficient as regards raw materials via recycling in addtion to domestic supply.\nHowever, last year EU Commisions was considering ESHA proposal to classify lithium as toxic - bad news for EU mining, specifically for lithium mining, processing, cathode production and recycling.\nThis brings problems in factries in Portugal and Germany, and also in Serbia.\nImportant development in the US in connection with Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which has incentivised the whole battery cycle through tax credits. The attractiveness of this package is in stacking of bonuses (credits) on all steps of production of batteries, from refining to putting together of battery packs; and 50% pricing control on raw materials, all of which produces long term incentives.This creates attractiveness for companies to move business to the US, to have the whole process done in the US as the bonuses are linked to purely US based manufacture and assembly.\nRussia has 10% of raw materials, so the EU could consider this source.\nDirect lithium extraction (DLE) and DL product could provide for 10% of demannd of lithium supply by 2030, recycling of batteries could provide for 6% by the same date. Batteries will represent 95% of total demand of lithium by 2030.\n \nAGENDA FOR INTERNAL MEETING\nPROPOSALS/RECOMMENDATIONS in line with political priorities\n1) Strong support of lithium mining from geothermal sources due to lack of health hazard\n2) Legislation aimed at gradual cessation of supply of lithium-ion from Asia whilst increasing EU based supply via recycling and non-hazardous sources.\n3) Introduction of incentivisation of producers similar to US, for example 10 Eur per kwh, 10 Eur per cell assembly etc,, to attract companies and create strong base in long term.\n4) Increase supply from Chile, Argentina, Australia in shot and medium term.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 3.0\n\n"}]}

The proposal aims to strengthen the functioning of the internal market, promoting a circular economy and reducing the environmental and social impact throughout all stages of the battery life cycle. The initiative is closely linked to the European Green Deal, the Circular Economy Action Plan, and the New Industrial Strategy. \nAt the end of last year, The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional political agreement on the proposal. For the first time the legislation will regulate the entire life cycle of a battery \u2013 from the supply chain of raw materials, over the production to reuse and recycling of batteries \u2013 and ensure that they are safe, sustainable, and competitive.\nAs you know, our unit has the lead on this important file and our DG intends to launch the formal interservice consultation over the coming weeks. Before this, our DG wants to organize an internal reflection and brainstorming meeting, and I have been appointed to chair this meeting.\nCould you produce an internal memo, summarizing the main ins and outs of this file and the agenda for the internal meeting with concrete proposals and recommendations to fine-tune the original proposal, in line with the political priorities of the co-legislators. \nI\u2019m on mission tomorrow so please could you get this done for me today. It doesn\u2019t need to be long \u2013 in fact the shorter, the better.  \n\nMany thanks\n\nCase Study Content: \n,\n\nFerdinand\nHead of Unit\n\n\n\n\nIs Europe Moving Fast Enough to Build a Resilient Lithium Supply Chain? \nPriscila Barrera\nNov. 16, 20XX-1\n\n\nEurope will soon release its Critical Raw Materials Act to identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk.\nEurope\u2019s green energy transition plans give a central role to the electrification of transportation. \nThe European Union (EU) has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Recently proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035.\nIn 20XX-2, electric car registrations for the year were close to 1,729,000, up from 1,061,000 in 2020, with prospects for the region remaining positive. Last year, the market share of battery electric cars almost doubled to around 10 percent, but challenges faced by carmakers continue to weigh on demand as inflation and fears of a recession put pressure on targets. \nIn its most recent forecast, the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA) said it expects the overall EU car market to shrink again this year, slipping by 1 percent to reach 9.6 million units.\n\u201cTo ensure a return to growth \u2014 with an even greater share of electric vehicle sales so climate targets can be met \u2014 we urgently need the right framework conditions to be put in place,\u201d said Oliver Zipse, ACEA president and CEO of BMW. \u201cThese include greater resilience in Europe\u2019s supply chains, an EU Critical Raw Materials Act that ensures strategic access to the raw materials needed for e-mobility, and an accelerated roll-out of charging infrastructure.\u201d\nAs sales of electric vehicles increase, carmakers are looking to secure supply of key metals used in batteries, including lithium. Today, Europe is quite dependent on Australia and Chile for lithium supply and China for lithium refining, but the region is taking steps to strengthen its supply chain for the important battery metal. \nWhat is the European Critical Raw Materials Act? \nIn September, news broke that Europe will be putting forward the European Critical Raw Materials Act, a new piece of legislation. Its aim is to identify potential strategic projects and build up reserves where supply is at risk.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc has learned its lesson about the risks of being dependent on Russia, and realizes the need to be vigilant toward China.\n\"In the case of China, it is the risk of dependency on technologies and raw materials,\" she said, adding that the EU needs to boost its production capacity and shift more towards trustworthy suppliers.\nIn October, von der Leyen said the EU is witnessing quite an acceleration of trends and tensions with China. \n\"The Chinese system is fundamentally different from ours and we are aware of the nature of the rivalry,'' she said.\nThe moves from the EU are in line with pushes seen in other regions such as North America, where the US has committed billions of dollars to reach its carbon emissions targets.\nIn June, the Biden administration launched the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes climate incentives. The legislation, which was signed into law in August, requires automakers to source 50 percent of critical minerals used in electric vehicle batteries from North America or free trade agreement countries by 2024, with that amount rising to 80 percent by the end of 20XX+3.\nFor its part, Canada recently ordered three Chinese companies to divest from lithium companies following a \u201cmulti-step national security review process.\u201d China has opposed the move, and Canada is expected to release its China strategy soon.\nEurope-Asia relationship in the lithium space \nJack Bedder of Project Blue said Asia will always be a part of the European lithium-ion battery supply chain. Major Asian companies, including Panasonic, Samsung, BYD Company and CATL, all have operating capacity on the continent.\n\u201cAs a result, it will be almost impossible to detach fully from Chinese-owned supply across all stages of the lithium-ion supply chain,\u201d he told the Investing News Network.\nHowever, as lithium processing capacity is built up globally at non-Chinese-owned companies, particularly within the EU, the opportunities to reduce the EU's dependency on China-owned supply will improve. \u201cIt is very unlikely that the EU will implement legislation directly prohibiting lithium supply from Chinese-owned companies, as further constraints on supply availability to the European market will only hinder growth in the industry over the coming decade,\u201d Bedder added.\nFor Allan Pedersen of Wood Mackenzie, Europe cannot move forward without influence from Asia in the short to medium term.\nThat\u2019s due to a few reasons. As mentioned, many of the battery plants being constructed in Europe have Asian companies behind them, and the cathodes needed in batteries are still largely produced in Asia, where the know-how is strongest. Additionally, lithium refining is mainly done in China and most mineral concentrate is produced in Australia.\n\u201cChina has a multi-year advantage over the rest of the world in terms of investing in the entire supply chain \u2014 it will be challenging for Europe to catch up to that in terms of investment in know-how, processing equipment and resources,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that Europe cannot make progress in this space. In lithium, we see some resource developments and processing facilities being considered and constructed.\u201d\nFor the analyst, in the long-term Europe has the potential to become more self-sufficient for raw materials as recycling becomes a larger part of the supply landscape and can supplement domestic resources.\nEuropean Commission could classify lithium as toxic. \nAlthough Europe is pushing to build a resilient supply chain by partnering with allies and developing domestic resources, it might not all be good news for miners in the region \u2014 at the end of last year, the European Commission said it will weigh a proposal from the European Chemicals Agency to classify lithium carbonate, chloride and hydroxide as dangerous for human health.\nIf the proposal is approved, this could undermine the EU\u2019s attempt to create and support a domestic battery materials supply chain, research firm Rystad Energy said in a statement. \u201cThe EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium to supply its nascent electric vehicle production sector and the classification may increase its reliance on other regions, at a time when the union is focused on energy security and reducing emissions,\u201d the document reads.\nIf the classification goes ahead, it would not stop lithium usage, but it is highly likely to have an impact on at least four stages: lithium mining, processing, cathode production and recycling.\n\u201cThis potential ruling comes at a time when the EU is itself scrambling to build and establish local lithium supply chains. The permitting issue has repeatedly been highlighted at recent industry events as one of the main barriers to new mining projects ramping up quickly in the EU,\u201d according to Rystad Energy analysts. \u201cThere is also further risk of potential projects losing local community support for building lithium mines and processing operations.\u201d\nEditorial Disclosure: The Investing News Network does not guarantee the accuracy or thoroughness of the information reported in the interviews it conducts.

The European Chemicals Agency or ECHA initiated the process.\nThe European Union has been making its environmental and climate rules stricter for decades. The administration in Brussels wants to make the entire continent carbon neutral by mid-century. At the same time, it is striving to achieve the highest level of protection from pollution in the world.\nThe energy transition and the decarbonization of industrial activity and power plants imply massive deployment of renewables, mostly solar and wind farms. However, as they depend on unstable weather conditions, the electric power system requires energy storage, in which the EU counts a lot on batteries.\nDangerous critical raw material\nLithium-ion solutions still dominate the sector, though there are other technologies emerging that could popularize less harmful material for home units and the batteries for electronic devices, electric vehicles, and utility systems. At the same time, the European Commission is struggling to secure supply chains that would make the availability of lithium stable and make the EU almost self-sufficient by 20XX+7.\nThe European Union has added lithium to a list of critical raw materials as demand is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years.\nInitiatives to open mines and ore processing plants such as the ones in Serbia and Portugal have caused a public uproar as environmentalists and the local population are fearful about the impact on nature and people\u2019s livelihoods. In other projects, engineers are trying to make the extraction of lithium from geothermal waters cost effective and harmless, without any mining.\nStricter rules for handling lithium would lift costs\nHowever, the entire concept could falter with the European Commission\u2019s upcoming legislation. Namely, it is considering the proposal from the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA, to declare key lithium salts hazardous for human health, Reuters reported. If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, and handling of the materials.\nECHA\u2019s Risk Assessment Committee accepted the demand from France in September to classify lithium salts as damaging for fertility and unborn children and to declare the substances harmful for breastfed children.\nAdding lithium salts to the list of materials hazardous for health may prompt the revision of a range of projects in the industry.\nStricter rules mean higher costs, so any lithium ore processing plant project, like the one in the Jadar area in Serbia, would need to be given a second look regarding its environmental impact and feasibility.\nAlbemarle, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has indicated it may be forced to close its plant in Langelsheim in north Germany if the plan is accepted. In that case, Chief Financial Officer Scott Tozier said, the company wouldn\u2019t be able to import lithium chloride, its primary feedstock.\nThe unit\u2019s annual revenue is USD 500 million, and the plant has over 600 employees. Tozier warned a decision to declare lithium salts hazardous would prompt an exodus of EU producers including battery recyclers.\nThe decision is expected to be reached by early next year, the article adds.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Really Big Battery Deal in the IRA That People Are Missing\nBy Zachary Shahan \u2013 Published September 23, 20XX-1\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, almost all the discussion has been around the consumer tax credit for buying an electric vehicle, including the interesting new battery aspects of that. That\u2019s a big topic, but there\u2019s a whole other battery angle separate from the consumer tax credit, and it\u2019s huge.\nThe short summary of the whole thing is that the IRA incentives for nearly every stage of battery production and the battery supply chain are very attractive, and since they stack on top of each other, the IRA is likely to stimulate a \u201cgold rush\u201d of sorts in battery mineral mining, battery mineral refining, battery cell production, battery recycling, and battery pack production in the United States. When you also consider that consumers will need to get batteries whose components don\u2019t come from China, and that come from North America eventually, then it\u2019s essentially a given that everyone in the industry now knows it should have battery mineral mining and refining as well as battery cell and pack production in North America.\n\nSK Innovation Georgia battery factory rendering, courtesy of SK Innovation.\nThe Current EV Battery Mineral Situation\nFirst, let\u2019s note where we\u2019re starting from. The USA currently mines and refines close to 0% of the minerals that go into EV battery packs. China, on the other hands, mines or refines the majority of all the big ones, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. Here\u2019s a chart on Chinese EV battery mineral domination:\n\nMoney, Money, Money\nLooking at the data, the idea that Joe Biden was going to stimulate a gold rush in the EV battery mineral mining and refining space was a dream some of us had, but it seemed like one of the more outlandish dreams we could have in this time and age. However, the market does respond to three things pretty well: money, money, money, and money. And the Biden administration, Prime Minister Manchin, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and others involved in crafting the legislation took note and decided to offer all four.\nThe slight joke here, aimed at emphasizing the key point, is that the IRA seems to be offering cash money (tax credits) for mining battery minerals, for refining battery minerals, for putting together battery cells, and for putting together battery packs (or \u201cmodules\u201d). If you do all those things, you don\u2019t get one bonus, you get four bonuses. If you count all the different minerals in a battery, the number of potential bonuses is much larger. Those bonuses add up, and they make it much more appealing to bring full-cycle battery production to the USA. At the very least, it should open mining and refining projects \u2014 which are more or less non-existent in the United States \u2014 by making them much more bankable. (Side note: Canadian and Mexican locations hoping to attract battery manufacturing investment may not have figured it out yet, but their competitive position versus the US took a major hit when Biden signed the IRA.)\nThat\u2019s why we recently got news of Tesla reportedly deciding to scrap some investments it had already made in Germany (but not all of them) and move some battery cell production stateside. That\u2019s why Tesla is reportedly exploring lithium refining in Texas now as well. That\u2019s why GM is reportedly accelerating its exploration of EV battery mineral supplies from US soil. \u201cOur thought process was that we would do this over a period of time, but with the IRA, we are actively working on figuring out how to accelerate,\u201d said Sham Kunjur, GM\u2019s executive director for EV raw materials. But this is only the beginning. These are just the leaks from early movers and leaky groups. Whether it\u2019s Tesla, GM, Volkswagen, Ford, Panasonic, SK Innovation, LG Energy Solution (previously known as LG Chem), Samsung SDI, Albemarle, Livent, Piedmont Lithium, Talon Metals, Lithium Americas, Pilbara Minerals, or others, corporate teams are looking at the IRA, having their lawyers look at it, and starting to look much more seriously at what production opportunities they can launch in the United States.\nLooking at the Actual IRA Language\nSection 45X of the IRA concerns \u201ccomponents produced and sold after December 31, 2022.\u201d Near the beginning, it states that \u201cany taxable year is an amount equal to the sum of the credit amounts determined under subsection (b) with respect to each eligible component.\u201d In other words, if you get a tax credit for one component of a battery (raw lithium, for example), you can also go and get a tax credit for another component or even later stage of the same component (the refined lithium, for example). The tax credits are for each major stage of the production process, and that means you can get them for various components of a battery and various stages of processing or putting together those components. You can get the following credits:\n10% of the cost of battery electrode active materials\n$35/kWh of battery cell capacity\n$10/kW of battery module capacity (or, for a battery module that does not use battery cells, $45/kWh)\n10% of the cost of producing a battery mineral.\nAlso, while there\u2019s a phaseout for some of these between 2030 and 2032, there is no phaseout at all for the critical mineral subsidies! That\u2019s long-term stability for a market that needs it.\nWhat Minerals & Battery Components Are Eligible?\nRegarding electrode active materials, those include \u201ccathode materials, anode materials, anode foils, and electrochemically active materials, including solvents, additives, and electrolyte salts that contribute to the electrochemical processes necessary for energy storage.\u201d\nApplicable critical minerals include aluminum/alumina, antimony/antimony trisulfide concentrate, barite/barium sulfate, beryllium/copper-beryllium master alloy, cerium/cerium oxide, cesium/cesium formate/cesium carbonate, chromium/ferrochromium, cobalt/cobalt sulfate, graphite/graphitic carbon, lithium/lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide, manganese, nickel/nickel sulphate, and many others.\nNotably, at the end, it\u2019s noted that only production that takes place in the United States is eligible for these tax credits. This creates a \u201cUSA premium\u201d in the supply of raw materials to facilities that want to get the maximum benefit from 45X. Any manufacturer will be eligible for a 45X tax credit which covers the yearly cost of production if their facility is using raw material from the US. For most manufacturing, raw material cost is the most significant component of OPEX after labor and energy. So, Biden, Schumer, Manchin, and their aides have been very clever here: \u201cwant the maximum benefit, Buy American.\u201d\nSo, let\u2019s go back to the example of Tesla (or you can use Ford, GM, or some other company in this hypothetical if you prefer). Tesla could, theoretically, get a tax credit for mining lithium, get a tax credit for refining lithium, get a tax credit for mining nickel, get a tax credit for refining nickel, get a tax credit for producing battery anodes, get a tax credit for producing battery cells, and get a tax credit for producing battery modules. Of course, Tesla isn\u2019t going to do all those things. However, I think that helps to explain the potential here. Whereas Tesla won\u2019t do all those things itself, companies and investors will be pouring into the United States to do them, and some automakers will deepen their vertical integration in the battery space as well.\nAs a final note, and perhaps as a teaser for something we\u2019ll come back to, while the incentives from the IRA are attractive, so is the potential for pricing control over raw materials! Whether Ford, GM, or Tesla, having more secure, stable, predictable control over key raw material costs could go a long way in being competitive and financially sustainable in the coming decade. How much is that pricing control worth as we go from ~5% EV market share in the US auto industry to 50% or more?\n\nRussia may launch lithium production in the coming four years\nJune 17, 20XX-1\n| As said at the SPIEF Oleg Kazanov, Director of the All-Russian Institute of Mineral Resources (VIMS) under Federal Subsoil Resources Management Agency, Russia may start lithium mining based on the ore deposits in the Murmansk region in 3-4 years and become one of the world\u2019s five largest producers in eight years\u2019 time.  |  |\n\u201cRussia has a lithium resource base, which is 10% of the world\u2019s reserves and explored back in the 60s of the previous century. This is almost 4 million tons in 15 explored deposits. The first two objects in the Murmansk region will gain licensing and active subsoil use by the end of the current year. I think production might start there already in the next three or four years. Moreover, these are world-class deposits, both in terms of the lithium reserves and content,\u201d O. Kazanov said.\nAccording to him, now the demand for lithium is boosting in the world. Its driver is the battery industry. \u201cAlready in the next 10 years, we will see an increase from the current 100,000 tons of lithium consumption to about 700,000 tons. In total, 88 deposits of ore lithium will be launched in the world soon, but it is not enough to cover its entire global demand,\u201d the expert notes.\nMeanwhile, in Russia, a peculiar situation has developed in the lithium industry. The country has huge reserves of ore lithium reaching 10% of the world\u2019s. Besides, Russia discovered lithium reserves in solutions in the bottom waters of the oil and gas fields in the Angara-Lena region, but they have not been fully assessed yet. The lithium content in solutions is very high by the world standards, i.e., about 300 mg/l.\nThere are two large lithium processing plants in Russia the Krasnoyarsk chemical-metallurgical plant, which buy raw lithium from Chile, bring it up to battery quality and ship to Southeast Asia.\nAgainst the background of this situation, Federal Subsoil Resources Management Agency has recognized development of the lithium ore and brine reserves as a priority area.\nLithium ore mining technologies already exist; they scale well, especially considering increase of the demand for lithium and its price rise. \u201cI think already on ore lithium, in the prospect of the next eight years, we are going to be among the top five producers of this metal along with Chile, Argentina, China and Australia,\u201d O. Kazanov noted.\nThe next stage in the Russia\u2019s lithium industry development after the ore deposits have been commissioned will be application of the technologies for lithium production from solutions. In the world, this is the DLE technology mainly used for solutions at geothermal power plants. In Russia, lithium solutions are found in the bottom waters of oil and gas fields. This water is somehow extracted from the subsoil and injected back into the reservoir to maintain pressure in an oil and gas well.\nThe engineering center created based on the Krasnoyarsk chemical-metallurgical plant and VIMS developed its own technologies for lithium extraction just during a year, and now they are tested under the laboratory conditions.\n\nBy Marcelo Azevedo, Magdalena Baczy\u0144ska, Ken Hoffman, and Aleksandra Krauze\nLithium is the driving force behind electric vehicles, but will supply keep pace with demand? New technologies and sources of supply can fill the gap. \nDespite expectations that lithium demand will rise from approximately 500,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2021 to some three million to four million metric tons in 2030, we believe that the lithium industry will be able to provide enough product to supply the burgeoning lithium-ion battery industry. Alongside increasing the conventional lithium supply, which is expected to expand by over 300 percent between 2021 and 2030, direct lithium extraction (DLE) and direct lithium to product (DLP) can be the driving forces behind the industry\u2019s ability to respond more swiftly to soaring demand. Although DLE and DLP technologies are still in their infancy and subject to volatility given the industry\u2019s \u201chockey stick\u201d 1 demand growth and lead times, they offer significant promise of increasing supply, reducing the industry\u2019s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) footprint, and lowering costs, with already announced capacity contributing to around 10 percent of the 2030 lithium supply, as well as to other less advanced projects in the pipeline.\nHowever, satisfying the demand for lithium will not be a trivial problem. Despite COVID-19\u2019s impact on the automotive sector, electric vehicle (EV) sales grew by around 50 percent in 2020 and doubled to approximately seven million units in 2021. At the same time, surging EV demand has seen lithium prices skyrocket by around 550 percent in a year: by the beginning of March 2022, the lithium carbonate price had passed $75,000 per metric ton and lithium hydroxide prices had exceeded $65,000 per metric ton (compared with a five-year average of around $14,500 per metric ton). \nLithium is needed to produce virtually all traction batteries currently used in EVs as well as consumer electronics. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are widely used in many other applications as well, from energy storage to air mobility. As battery content varies based on its active materials mix, and with new battery technologies entering the market, there are many uncertainties around how the battery market will affect future lithium demand. For example, a lithium metal anode, which boosts energy density in batteries, has nearly double the lithium requirements per kilowatt-hour compared with the current widely used mixes incorporating a graphite anode.\nSo, will there be enough lithium to cover the needs of a new electrified world? As discussed in our recent article, \u201cThe raw-materials challenge: How the metals and mining sector will be at the core of enabling the energy transition,\u201d arriving at a considered answer and understanding the entire supply-and-demand context will be crucial for every player along the value chain\u2014mining companies, refiners, battery manufacturers, and automotive OEMs.\nLithium demand factors\nOver the next decade, McKinsey forecasts continued growth of Li-ion batteries at an annual compound rate of approximately 30 percent. By 2030, EVs, along with energy-storage systems, e-bikes, electrification of tools, and other battery-intensive applications, could account for 4,000 to 4,500 gigawatt-hours of Li-ion demand.\n  \nNot long ago, in 2015, less than 30 percent of lithium demand was for batteries; the bulk of demand was split between ceramics and glasses (35 percent) and greases, metallurgical powders, polymers, and other industrial uses (35-plus percent). By 2030, batteries are expected to account for 95 percent of lithium demand, and total needs will grow annually by 25 to 26 percent to reach 3.3 million to 3.8 million metric tons LCE depending on the scenarios outlined in Exhibit 2. \n\n\nReuse and recycle\nA frequently asked question is whether L-ion batteries can be recycled. With expected battery lifetimes of around ten to 15 years for passenger vehicles, and the possibility of extending EV battery life through use in the energy-storage sector, battery recycling is expected to increase during the current decade, but not to game-changing levels. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in end-of-life batteries. By 2030, such secondary supply is expected to account for slightly more than 6 percent of total lithium production (Exhibit 7).\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nDear Ferdinand, this is the memo Is make with the hepl of the documentation we have.\nMEMO.\n1. INTRODUCCTION\nThe european union has ambitious goals to become climate neutral by 2050, meaning it would be an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.In fact, recently EU proposed legislation is looking to effectively ban all internal combustion engine cars by 2035. \nIn 202x-2 electric car registrations for the year were 1.729.000, 60% up from 2020. \nThe administrtion in Brussels has been making ist environmetal and climate rules stricter for decades. the EU wants to make the entire continent carbon neutral by mid century. At the same time, it is etriving to achieve the highest level of protection from pollution in the world. Favourishing electric cars industry is an important point to manage its targets.\n \n2. POINTS IN\nDespite expectations that litium demand will rise from aproximately 500.000 metric tons of tithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2021, to some 3 or 4 million metric tons in 2030, it is expected that the lithium industry will be able to porvide enough product to supply the burgeoning tithioum-ion battery industry. \nIt is important to remark that the possibility of extending Electric vehicle battery life through use in the energy storage sector. Also it is important pay attention that battery recicling is expected to increase during the current decade. Depending on the recycling process employed, it is possible to recover between zero and 80 percent of the lithium contained in the end-life batteries.\n \n3. POINTS OUT\nThe energy transition and the decarbonization of industrial activity and power plants imply massive deployment of renovables, mostly solar and wind farms. However, as they depend on unstable weather conditions, the electric power system requires energy storage, in which the EU counts a lot on batteries.\nThe EU currently relies heavily on imports of lithium to supply its electric vehicle production sector and the classification of lithium as toxic may increase its reliance on other regions, at a time when the Union is focused on energy security and reducing emissions.\nThe Eu has  added lithium to a list of critical raw materials as demand is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years. Adding lithium salts to the list of materials hazardous for the health may propt re revision of a range of projets in the industry.\nOthe point to study is that lithium reclycling is stills small scale although it it could reach 6 percent of announced supply by 2030.\n \n4. PROPOSALS\nIt is fundamental, to emphasize the economic key point. \nOffering cash money (tax credits) all the steps in the lithium electric car batteries production, for mining battery minerals, refining them, putting together battery cells and for putting together battery packs (or modules), could be essential to reduce the dependence of Asia and America.\nWorking on the investigation to increase recycling industry related to lithium form used electric car batterys must be actively favourised thought founding mechanismes.\n \n5. PRIORITIES OF THE CO-LEGISTATORS\nThe European Union is working in a very complicated environment. Not only war in Ucrania has obliged to review the economic expectations, but also the increasing prices of imported materials from China, important inputs for european indlustry.\nIt is important that Co-legislators create new founding squemes to favourise the electric car industry and also the reclycling industry favourising the study of reclycliong process of lithium batteries. It will be a hard work for Science, Environtment and industry Ministrys, which have to work in a same direction, becoming climate neutral by 2050.\n \n6. CONCLUSION\nThere is a lot of work to do but our indicators show that the EU runs in a good way. Our DG needs to work listening the needs of european citizens and Move industries, proposing founds and financial help conditions, managing the industrial deveolepment and the resilience.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 3.0\n\n"}]}

These rules will implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which the European Parliament and the Council (i.e. the EU Member States) are expected to adopt in the coming months.\nThe Commission, through the SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system.\n\nCould you prepare a draft press release, announcing this blueprint within its wider context and send it to the Press Service by tonight?\n\n\n\n\nLouis Bl\u00e9riot,\nHead of Unit\n\nCase Study Content: \nRIGA DECLARATION\nON REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT (drones)\n\"FRAMING THE FUTURE OF AVIATION\"\n\nRiga - 6 March 20XX-2\n\n\nToday Europe is taking a decisive step towards the future of aviation. The European aviation community gathered in Riga to exchange views on how, and under which conditions, drones can help create promising new opportunities in Europe, offering sustainable jobs and new prospects for growth both for the manufacturing industry and for future users of drones in all sectors of society. Drones offer new services and applications going beyond traditional aviation and offer the promise to perform existing services in a more affordable and environmentally friendly way. They are a truly transformational technology.\n\nThe Latvian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, European Commission representatives, Directors General of Civil Aviation of the EU Member States, data protection authorities and leaders of manufacturing industry and service providers confirmed the importance of joint European action, building on the orientations given in the EC Communication on opening the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) market. \n\nThe aviation community stressed the necessity for European regulators to ensure that all the conditions are met for the safe and sustainable emergence of innovative drone services. At the same time regulations must help the industry to thrive and adequately deal with citizens\u2019 concerns.\nThe aviation community established the following principles to guide the regulatory framework in Europe:\n1. Drones need to be treated as new types of aircraft with proportionate rules based on the risk of each operation.\nThe provision of drone services must not be less safe than is accepted from civil aviation in general. The incremental integration of drones in the aviation system must not reduce the level of safety presently achieved in civil aviation. Although no one is on board the drone, people in other aircraft or on the ground could get hurt in case of an accident or an unscheduled landing. The way safety is regulated must be proportional to the operational risk involved.\nRules should be simple and performance based, to allow a small start-up company or individuals to start low-risk, low-altitude operations under minimal rules and to develop, with light-touch risk-based regulation, similar to the modern product safety regulations applied in other sectors. Higher risk operations would be gradually subject to more stringent regulations or operational limitations. At the other end of the spectrum, where the operational risk is highest, such as with large drones operating alongside manned aircraft, the regulation will need to be quite similar to that applying to manned aviation, with strict standards on the design, manufacturing, maintenance and operation of drones, as well as on the training of drone pilots and maintenance personnel.\n\n2. EU rules for the safe provision of drone services need to be developed now.\nSafety rules, including on remote pilot and operator qualifications, should be developed at the European level by the European Aviation Safety Agency, building on the experience developed in the EU Member States. The essential requirements should be harmonised at the global level to the maximum extent possible, and full use should be made of the established cooperation in the Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems (JARUS) and at ICAO, and should be completed by international industry standard setting bodies. Important efforts need to be put into resourcing these activities, especially JARUS, in order to ensure that the progressive risk-based approach is consistent with what is done in the rest of the world.\nThis basic regulatory framework should be put in place without delay, in order to help the private sector to take well-informed investment decisions, and to provide a basic set of rules for the many operators who are increasingly eager to begin providing services. The European Aviation Safety Agency should consult stakeholders by the middle of next year on the regulatory framework for the operations of drones and on concrete regulatory proposals for low-risk operations. By the end of next year the Agency will use the results of the consultation to propose a position on these matters. The proposal for the revision of the basic European Safety Regulation, which the European Commission has announced for next year, should contain the necessary new provisions and essential requirements for the progressive risk-based regulation of drones, based on the Agency's recommendations.\n\n3. Technologies and standards need to be developed for the full integration of drones in the European airspace.\nThe success of drone activities and safety regulations also depends on the financial effort to develop and validate key missing technologies and the ensuing required standards. Both industry and public authorities stressed the need for adequate investment in the technologies that are required to integrate drones into the aviation system \u2014 the SESAR programme. Clean Sky and other initiatives should complete the SESAR investments. That would create spin-offbenef1ts for traditional aviation and so frame the future of \ufb02ying.\n\n4. Public acceptance is key to the growth of drone services.\nThe respect of citizens\u2019 fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, must be guaranteed. Many drone services involve data-gathering such as \ufb01lming, etc. The responsible authorities, such as the national and European Data Protection Authorities, should develop the necessary guidelines and monitoring mechanisms to ensure the full respect of existing protection rules, including in relation to drones. Rules need to clarify what is acceptable and what is not, and they require to be properly enforced.\nDrones may cause nuisances and negative externalities, such as noise. These nuisances need to be addressed, possibly at the local level, to maintain public acceptance.\nDrones also pose potential security risks. The design of drones can and should take into account those risks by using methods such as cyber-defence or geofencing. However, the malicious use of drones cannot be entirely prevented by design or operational restrictions. It is the task of the national police and justice systems to address those risks.\n5. The operator of a drone is responsible for its use.\nWhen a drone service is delivered in prohibited airspace, in an unsafe manner, or for illegal purposes, the authorities should be able to act and hold the operator accountable. Where lacking, this will need to be clarified in national law. Moreover, in order to enforce responsibility, it will be necessary for drones to have at all times an identi\ufb01able owner or operator. The regulator should seek the least bureaucratic way to achieve this. For instance, the mandating of electronic identity chips on drones - \u201cIDrones\u201d - as is today envisaged in some states, could be formalised through a safety rule, which would contribute to the effective implementation of privacy and security requirements. Standardised web-portals in the Member States for the registration of operators and their operations could be another solution. The involved authorities need to work closely together.\nDrone accidents will happen. Member States should clarify the applicable insurance and third party liability regime and monitor the compensation mechanisms for potential victims. The establishment of compensation funds to cover victims of accidents caused by uninsured drone users, as used in the motor insurance sector, could be envisaged. Reporting on drone incidents should be integrated into the overall incident reporting requirements. Systematic and coherent incident reporting will improve safety and will be instrumental for insurance companies in their risk analysis on which third party liability insurance premiums are based.\nTo allow a short reaction time, the development of drone services and drone technologies needs close monitoring. To this end, the EU should establish an easy access for SMEs to information required for drone manufacturing and service provision, together with an observatory to keep track of the growing number of operations in Europe and the evolution of innovation. This monitoring will permit informed decisions relative to the establishment of priorities for future legislation. It will also help regulators to learn from experience and verify that the rules are fit for purpose, namely to ensure that new technologies and drone services can develop in full respect of the required high levels of safety, security, privacy and environmental protection. An annual progress report should be published.\nThe European aviation community gathered in Riga today is committed to working together on the basis of these principles to allow businesses to provide drone services everywhere in Europe as from 20XX-1 onwards.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe demand for drone services is steadily increasing, with the potential to generate significant economic growth and societal benefits, as recognised in the 20XX-2 EU Aviation Strategy, and more recently in the SESAR Drones Outlook Study and Warsaw Declaration on drones. In order to realise this potential, the Declaration calls for \u201curgent action on the airspace dimension, in particular the development of the concept of U-space\u201d. Ultimately, U-space will enable complex drone operations with a high degree of automation to take place in all types of operational environments, including urban areas. U-space must be flexible enough to encourage innovation, support the development of new businesses and facilitate the overall growth of the European drone services market while properly addressing, at EU level, safety and security issues, respecting the privacy of citizens, and minimising the environmental impact. This blueprint outlines the proposed vision for U-space and how it could be rolled out. Rather than providing a definitive solution, this blueprint provides the basis to better define the way drones will operate in Europe in the future. \nWhat is U-space?\nU-space is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for large numbers of drones. These services rely on a high level of digitalisation and automation of functions, whether they are on board the drone itself, or are part of the ground-based environment. U-space provides an enabling framework to support routine drone operations, as well as a clear and effective interface to manned aviation.\n\nWhat are the key principles of U-space?\nThe delivery of U-space relies upon the following key principles:\nTo ensure the safety of all airspace users operating in the U-space framework, as well as people on the ground.\nTo provide a scalable, flexible and adaptable system that can respond to changes in demand, volume, technology, business models and applications, while managing the interface with manned aviation.\nTo enable high-density operations with multiple automated drones under the supervision of fleet operators.\nTo guarantee equitable and fair access to airspace for all users.\nTo enable competitive and cost-effective service provision at all times, supporting the business models of drone operators.\nTo minimise deployment and operating costs by leveraging, as much as possible, existing aeronautical services and infrastructure, including GNSS as well as those from other sectors, such as mobile communication services.\nTo accelerate deployment by adopting technologies and standards from other sectors where they meet the needs of U-space.\nTo follow a risk-based and performance-driven approach when setting up appropriate requirements for safety, security [including cyber-security] and resilience [including failure mode management], while minimising environmental impact and respecting the privacy of citizens, including data protection.\n\n\nHow will U-space operate?\nSubject to compliance with applicable regulations, operational limitations and technical requirements linked to the operation of the drone, U-space facilitates any kind of mission, from the delivery of goods, aerial work, and search and rescue, to more complex future applications such as urban air mobility.\nU-space services are offered to both private [leisure and professional] and public users of drones, for all types of missions. Some services will meet privacy and security needs expressed by the relevant authorities. In addition, the criticality of these services will lead to the establishment of performance requirements for both structural elements and service delivery, covering, for example, safety, security, availability, continuity and resilience.\nThe U-space framework comprises an extensive and scalable range of services relying on agreed EU standards and delivered by service providers. These services do not replicate the function of ATC \u201a as known in ATM, but deliver key services to organise the safe and efficient operation of drones and ensure a proper interface with manned aviation, ATC and relevant authorities. They may include the provision of data, supporting services for drone operators such as flight planning assistance and more structured services such as tracking or capacity management.\n\n\n\nUnmanned aircraft (most people call them \u2018drones\u2019) is a sector of aviation that is developing very fast and has a great potential for producing new jobs and growth. The term \u2018unmanned aircraft\u2019 includes very large aircraft similar in size and complexity to manned aircraft,\u00a0but also very small consumer electronics aircraft. Especially the smaller ones are increasingly being used in the Europe Union (EU), but under a fragmented regulatory framework. Basic national safety rules apply, but the rules differ across the EU and a number of key safeguards are not addressed in a coherent way.\nOn request by the European Commission, Member States and other stakeholders, the Agency started to develop a proposals for an operation centric, proportionate, risk- and performance-based regulatory framework for all unmanned aircraft (UA) establishing three categories with different safety requirements, proportionate to the risk:\n\u2018open\u2019 (low risk) is a UA operation category that, considering the risks involved, does not require a prior authorisation by the competent authority before the operation takes place;\n\u2018specific\u2019 (medium risk) is a UA operation category that, considering the risks involved, requires an authorisation by the competent authority before the operation takes place and takes into account the mitigation measures identified in an operational risk assessment, except for certain standard scenarios where a declaration by the operator is sufficient;\n\u2018certified\u2019 (high risk) is a UA operation category that, considering the risks involved, requires the certification of the UA, a licensed remote pilot and an operator approved by the competent authority, in order to ensure an appropriate level of safety.\nFollowing the publication of an advance NPA, a Technical Opinion, a \u2018Prototype\u2019 regulation\u00a0was drafted for the \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018specific\u2019 categories. The \u2018Prototype\u2019 regulation was published proposing actual rules providing the necessary clarity, notably on what are the responsibilities of the Member States and what is the flexibility offered to them.\nA significant number of comments has been received and together with the significant inputs provided by an expert group have been taken into account to further develop the regulation text leading to the publication of an NPA. An impact assessment details analysis of several potential options considered. The analysis benefited also from feedback provided by stakeholders.\nThe NPA has taken into consideration the developments in the international arena e.g. work done in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO); in the Joint Authorities for the Rulemaking of Unmanned Systems (JARUS) and of course in the USA (Federal Aviation Administration- FAA).\nThe proposal provides a framework to safely operate drones while allowing this industry to remain agile, to innovate and continue to grow. The risk posed to people on the ground and to other aircraft as well as privacy, security and data protection issues created by such drones are also taken into account.\nThe proposed regulation defines the technical and operational requirements for the drones. Technical requirements refer for example to the remote identification of drones.\u00a0 Operational requirements refer among others to geofencing; a system that ensures the drones does not enter a prohibited zone. The proposal also addresses the pilots\u2019 qualifications. Furthermore, drone operators will have to register themselves, except when they operate drones lighter than 250g.\nThis proposal is breaking new grounds by combining Product legislation and Aviation legislation. Indeed, design requirements for small drones will be implemented by using the legislation relative to making products available on the market (the well-known CE marking). The standard CE mark will be accompanied by the identification of the class of the drone (from C0 to C4) and by a do\u2019s and don\u2019ts leaflet that will be found in all drone boxes. Based on the drone class an operator will know in which area he can operate and what competence is required.\nThe proposal allows a high degree of flexibility for EASA Member States; they will be able to define zones in their territory where either drones operations are prohibited or restricted (for example to protect sensitive areas), or where certain requirements are alleviated.\nFor operations that pose higher risks, an operational risk assessment will define the requirements that the operator needs to comply before flying the drone.\nThe proposal also provides special alleviations for people flying model aircraft - which are also drones \u2013 to recognise the good safety records in aero modelling identifying 3 options:\nMember States may issue a special authorisation to model clubs and associations defining deviations from the UAS regulation;\nOperations can be conducted in specific zones designated by Member States; or\nOperations can be conducted in the open category according the operational limitations defined for one of the Subcategory (A3)\nEASA will submit a final Opinion to the European Commission at the end of 20XX, which will take into account the feedback, received to this proposal.\n\n\n\n\nDrone Alliance Europe (DAE) is a coalition of leading technology companies representing the commercial drone industry before European political leaders, regulators, and other industry stakeholders, as well as international regulatory and advisory bodies.\nThe commercial drone industry has the potential to bring tremendous economic growth, jobs, innovation, and broad societal benefits. Amid exponential industry growth and opportunity, it is critical to pursue a forward-leaning regulatory framework to fully realise this potential and further promote European leadership in research, production, and application of this technology.\nOur Mission\nThe Alliance leverages the experience and perspectives of member companies throughout the policymaking process to expedite the safe and widespread integration of commercial drones into European airspace. Together, the DAE represents a strong, united voice working toward the expeditious development of:\nProportionate, risk-based, pan-European regulations that facilitate a clear path toward authorization of expanded operations throughout the continent, including fully autonomous and beyond visual line of sight operations\nA low-cost, interoperable unmanned traffic management (UTM) framework\u00a0that promotes the safe and secure integration of expanded drone operations essential to industry growth\nA regulatory framework that embraces the flexible use of licensed, unlicensed, and spectrum sharing opportunities for drone technology necessary to support safe integration, innovation, and technology leadership throughout the Digital Single Market\n\nOur Members\n\n\n\nSecure your drone \u2013 or pay the price \nBy Nick Gibbons - cyber security expert and partner at BLM\nDrone technology offers many benefits \u2013 from the potential for speedy Amazon deliveries from the sky, to saving lives, as witnessed recently when the Lochaber mountain rescue team used one to find a hurt climber. \nBut on the flip side, there are risks associated with aerial technology, such as drone jacking or hacking. \nTypically, when the conversation moves to the subject of drone-jacking, people immediately envisage a Hollywood-style breach of national security, probably in or around the White House before Will Smith leaps in to save the day. \nHowever, attacks on this technology represent very real risks for the growing number of businesses using drones, such as engineers surveying buildings and infrastructure, e-commerce giants sending deliveries or companies gathering surveillance for insurance claims. \nEarlier this year, Amazon announced an expansion to its research and development team in Cambridge. This will see 400 technology specialists fine-tuning the technology behind delivery drones. Despite claims that such deliveries are \u201cpipe dreams\u201d, there is a growing market for commercial drone technology, and with this comes a growing risk of drone-jacking. \nLast November, a report from security software company McAfee predicted cybercriminals will soon turn their attention to targeting drones, particularly those used for law enforcement, filming and deliveries. \nDrones without adequate security in place will be vulnerable to hacks, as well as physical attacks. The report speculates 20XX will see an increase in availability, via the dark web, of pre-packaged software and toolkits for hacking drones. In these cases, hacking of the drone itself or its supporting software may result in either physical misuse or data breaches. Hacking for the physical diversion of a drone carries the potential for personal injury or property damage, actual theft of the drone or indeed, the item it was carrying. \nTheft of data is another real risk, particularly if the drone contains personal or sensitive information, whether customer data included for delivery purposes or footage collected via an attached camera. \nThe loss of data via drone-jacking leaves businesses and authorities with many privacy concerns, especially with the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into force in May 20XX+1. In recent years, there have been a raft of data breaches resulting in an invasion of privacy for customers of companies, including TalkTalk and Camelot, and breaches of the GDPR could entail fines of up to four per cent of a company\u2019s global turnover. \nAttacks are becoming more sophisticated and wide-reaching; recently, we saw the extensive damage hackers can unleash with the WannaCry cyber attack bringing organisations across the globe to a standstill. \nIf cyber attacks start targeting drones, drone-jacking could leave businesses and their customers equally exposed with regards to personal and commercial data, and the prospect of big fines levied by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. \nAlthough the use of drones is already, to an extent, covered by a range of laws and regulations, including the Data Protection Act, more specific, targeted legislation is necessary, as are effective insurance products for organisations using drones. This is especially important with the European Commission predicting full integration of drones into European airspace by 20XX+10. \nThe UK Government is clearly live to the emerging risks of drone technology. Following a recent consultation exercise, a registration system is to be launched for drones weighing 250g or more. The UK Government is considering the best legislative option for introducing the new rules. \nCurrently, a combination of existing insurance policies are required to cover risks associated with drone technology. As the risk of electronic theft of sensitive data rises, the market for specialised policies grows. \nIn the case of drone-jacking, it would be wise for a business to consider cyber risk policies available for first and third parties. These can provide protection against business interruption, reputational risks, loss or theft of third party corporate data notification expenses and the payment of compensation to individuals affected by security or privacy breaches. Care should be taken, however, when selecting a particular cyber policy, including detailed discussions with a specialised brokers. \nSo while drones have life-saving potential for Scotland\u2019s mountain rescue teams and a business may find investing in the technology an attractive proposition, an outbreak of drone-jacking could be hugely costly. It is critical that companies consider the security breaches drone-jacking could leave them open to, and invest in the appropriate protection \u2013 just in case Will Smith is not available. \n\n\n\nDrone flew 'within wingspan' of plane approaching Heathrow \nRob Davies\nA drone flew within 20 metres of a plane on the approach to Heathrow, while another shocked pilots by appearing at 3,000 metres (10,000ft), a monthly update on near-misses has revealed.\nCommercial jet pilots reported two \u201ccategory A\u201d incidents, the most serious class of near-miss, involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), known as drones.\nThe latest report comes amid concern that drone near-misses are on the rise, potentially posing a threat to recreational and commercial planes.\nIn one case, an Airbus A320 pilot on the approach to Heathrow in October last year spotted a drone within just 20 metres, or \u201cpossibly within the wingspan\u201d of the aircraft.\nInvestigators concluded that the drone had flown so close to the passenger jet that \u201cprovidence had played a major part in the aircraft not colliding\u201d. They also noted that the \u201cblue and disc-like\u201d craft appeared to be custom-made, rather than a commercially available model.\nIn the second of two serious UAV incidents, an A320 pilot taking off from Heathrow saw a red drone overhead, about 50 metres away from his right wing at about 1,000 metres.\nThe pilot noted that there would have been a \u201cdistinct possibility of damage\u201d had a collision occurred, while investigators found that \u201ca collision had only been narrowly avoided and chance had played a major part\u201d.\nA third drone sighting, deemed a less serious category B incident, involved an unmanned aircraft at an altitude that surprised pilots, who had \u201cno time to react\u201d.\nThe UK Airprox Board, which issues monthly reports on the threat of mid-air collisions, reported a pilot saying: \u201cWas that a drone? At 10,000 ft!\u201d\nLarge drones are not permitted to fly above 120 metres, or close to airports.\nThe \u201clarge drone\u201d, which appeared to be stationary, came within 60 metres (200ft) of the aircraft, a distance deemed less risky than the category A incidents, but nonetheless \u201ca situation where safety was not assured\u201d.\nA fourth drone sighting, involving a pilot on a sightseeing trip near the Binevenagh mountain in Northern Ireland, was deemed to be at the lowest level of risk, category E.\nIn all four cases, police were alerted but the operator of the drone could not be traced.\nMinisters are considering measures to enforce registration of all new drones so they can be better monitored, while the Department for Transport is also reviewing drone safety.\nPilots believe a collision with an airliner could be catastrophic and that the impact of a drone strike on a light plane or helicopter would almost certainly bring it down.\nThe British Airline Pilots Association has warned that the number of incidents could soar as people fly drones received as Christmas presents, often with little or no handling experience or understanding of the rules.\nThere have been 59 drone near-misses reported in the past 12 months. Drone sightings were among 21 incidents reported to the UK Airprox Board, six of which were deemed to be in the most serious category.\nAmong the other category A incidents was a near-miss in which a model aircraft was flown close to a Chinook military helicopter coming in to land at RAF Benson.\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Commission demands EU laws on drones after string of near-misses with aeroplanes\n, Brussels correspondent \n30 September 20XX-1 \u2022 8:20am \nThe European Commission has called for fresh impetus behind its stalled plans for EU-wide regulation of drones, after a string of near-misses with airplanes across Europe last year.\nThere were more than 1,200 \u201csafety occurrences\" involving drones in Europe last year, including several involving planes, the commission, the EU\u2019s civil service, said.\nOn April 22, a drone passed by the wingtip of  with 156 passengers as it came\u00a0into land at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. In 2016 three planes narrowly missed drones near Heathrow airport,  for tougher .\n\u201cIf we don't move fast enough, the near misses between drones and airplanes could one day have disastrous consequences,\u201d Violeta Bulc, the EU\u2019s transport commissioner said.\n\u201cDrones offer tremendous opportunities for new services and businesses,\u201d she said, \u201cbut safety always comes first\u201d.\nThe commission drafts laws, which are then amended separately by the European Parliament and national governments sitting in the Council of Ministers.

But now drones, and their makers, are navigating a third path between hobbyists and warfare into the industrial world, threatening a shake-up of the burgeoning $6bn industry. \nNew uses for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to give drones their technical name, are emerging almost daily: delivering packages, pizzas and blood; surveying mines; pre-emptive firefighting; even collecting whale snot to help conserve the mammals. \n\u201cWe are developing the UAV into a means of production,\u201d said Paul Xu, vice-president of DJI, at a conference in Shenzhen last month. His company has given China undisputed leadership in the sector, with its 70 per cent market share of non-military drones \nHowever, if Shenzhen-based DJI, valued at $8bn-$10bn at its last funding round in 20XX-2, is to keep that lead, it will need to adapt to new market dynamics. \nThe industry dismisses talk of \u201cpeak\u201d consumer drone, but few expect that part of the business to maintain its heady growth rates. Outside China, casualties abound: in California, Lily Robotics shut up shop in January, while 3D Robotics switched its focus to software and Parrot, of France, axed jobs. New entrants are cut from an altogether different cloth, with industrial and tech groups, including Qualcomm, Intel and Boeing hovering over the space. \nRegulators too are braced for change, as the industry lobbies for more openings. In a first step, the US Federal Aviation Administration, in effect, opened the skies to commercial drones a year ago, with limited safety rules covering the sector. \nSince the FAA rule changes, says Michael Perry, director of strategic partnerships at DJI, the enterprise industry has been scaling up rapidly, encouraged by the more certain regulatory environment. \u201cBefore we had conversations [with businesses] but then they said: \u2018How will my legal team deal with this?\u2019 The last thing we want is vagaries. People won\u2019t invest if they aren\u2019t sure.\u201d \nDJI, the creation of Frank Wang, a radio-controlled helicopter enthusiast from Hangzhou who transformed his boyhood hobby into a company with sales of $1.5bn, is now looking into areas ranging from agriculture to eliminating mosquitoes. \n\u201cPersonal drone vendors are now aggressively trying to position themselves in the commercial market,\u201d says Gerald Van Hoy, senior research analyst at Gartner, although the firm says the 3m drones it expects to be shipped this year will still be overwhelmingly for the consumer market. These figures are up 39 per cent on 20XX-1 and should translate into revenues of $6bn.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nINTERNAL NOTE (DG Mobility and Transport)\nThis internal note aims at assisting the press office to prepare a press release announcing the publication, by the Single Europeas Sky Air traffic management Research (SESAR) Joint Undertaking, of its blueprint for drone use in low-level air space. The publication of this blueprint, following a request of the Commission, is part of the Commission's Aviation Strategy, which requires an effective legal framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of concerns, notably safety.\nThe European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States (MS) and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules in order to implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which is expected to be adopted in the coming months.\nWithin this context, the Commission, through SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system.\nThis note will first highlight the opportunities and threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace (1) and it will then turn to the blueprint for drone use in low-level air space (2).\n1. Opportunities and threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace\n1.1. Opportunities of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace\n- Employement and growth:\nAccording to the European Air Safety Agency (EASA), unmanned aircraft has great potential for producing new jobs and growth.\n- New or better services:\nIn its Riga Declaration \"Framing the future of aviation\", the European aviation community further advocates that drones offer new services and applications going beyond traditional aviation and offer the promise to perform existing services in a more affordable and environmetal friedly way.\nThis aspect was also hightlighted in the press, where several potential benefits of drones have been put forward, from Amazon deliveries to rescue missions and fight against crime.\n1.2. Threats of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace:\n- Safety:\nSome concerns have been raised in the press that \"saferty occurences\" involving drones in Europe are on the rise, potentially posing a threat to recreational and commercial planes. Similar concerns have been raised by the European aviation community, which stated, in its recent Rega Declaration, that, althoigh no one is on board of a drone, people in other aicraft or on the ground could get hurt in case of an accident or an unscheduled landing.\n- Noise:\nThe European aviation community also identified other risks linked to the use of drones, such as nuisances and negatice externalities.\n- Right to privacy:\nIn its recent Riga Declaration, the European aviation community also raised concerns with respect to the protection of fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, as many drones involve data-gathering such as filming.\n- Security threats:\nAnother risk which has been put forward is the potential security risk linked to the malicious use of drones.\nIt can thus be said that the use of unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles in the European Airspace both has a lot of potential to foster European leadership and competitiveness, but also implied important risks that need to be mitigated through an effective legal framework.\n2. The blueprint for drone use in low-level air space\nThe purpose of this blueprint is to make drone use in low-level airspace safe, secure and environmentallu friendly. It will pave the way for the development of a strong and dynamic EU drone services market.\nThis blueprint oulines the proposed vision for the concept of \"U-space\", which is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace (altitudes of up to 150 meters) for large number of drones.\nThis paper outiles a number of basic principles:\ni) Safety at low level altitude levels:\nThe concept is to develop a system similar to that of Air Traffic Management (ATM) for manned aviation.\nii) Automated system:\nThe system will provide information for highly automated or autonomous drones to fly safely and avoid obstacles or collisions.\niii) Partly up and running by 20XX+2:\nIt will be the case for basic services like registration, e-identification and geo-fencing.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}]}

This \u201cU-space\u201d covers altitudes of up to 150 metres and will pave the way for the development of a strong and dynamic EU drone services market. The paper outlines a number of basic principles: \nSafe: safety at low altitude levels will be just as good as that for traditional manned aviation. The concept is to develop a system similar to that of Air Traffic Management for manned aviation.\nAutomated: the system will provide information for highly automated or autonomous drones to fly safely and avoid obstacles or collisions.\nUp and running by 20XX+2: for the basic services like registration, e-identification and geo-fencing. However, further U-Space services and their corresponding standards will need to be developed in the future.\nThe European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is currently working with Member States and industry to produce effective EU-wide safety rules that are proportionate to the risk of the operation. These rules will implement the EU's basic aviation safety regulation, which the European Parliament and the Council (i.e. the EU Member States) are expected to adopt in the coming months.\nThe Commission, through the SESAR Joint Undertaking, will further finance a range of drone projects, focusing on the integration of drones into the aviation system.\n\nCould you prepare a draft press release, announcing this blueprint within its wider context and send it to the Press Service by tonight?\n\n\n\n\nLouis Bl\u00e9riot,\nHead of Unit\n\nCase Study Content: \nRIGA DECLARATION\nON REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT (drones)\n\"FRAMING THE FUTURE OF AVIATION\"\n\nRiga - 6 March 20XX-2\n\n\nToday Europe is taking a decisive step towards the future of aviation. The European aviation community gathered in Riga to exchange views on how, and under which conditions, drones can help create promising new opportunities in Europe, offering sustainable jobs and new prospects for growth both for the manufacturing industry and for future users of drones in all sectors of society. Drones offer new services and applications going beyond traditional aviation and offer the promise to perform existing services in a more affordable and environmentally friendly way. They are a truly transformational technology.\n\nThe Latvian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, European Commission representatives, Directors General of Civil Aviation of the EU Member States, data protection authorities and leaders of manufacturing industry and service providers confirmed the importance of joint European action, building on the orientations given in the EC Communication on opening the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) market. \n\nThe aviation community stressed the necessity for European regulators to ensure that all the conditions are met for the safe and sustainable emergence of innovative drone services. At the same time regulations must help the industry to thrive and adequately deal with citizens\u2019 concerns.\nThe aviation community established the following principles to guide the regulatory framework in Europe:\n1. Drones need to be treated as new types of aircraft with proportionate rules based on the risk of each operation.\nThe provision of drone services must not be less safe than is accepted from civil aviation in general. The incremental integration of drones in the aviation system must not reduce the level of safety presently achieved in civil aviation. Although no one is on board the drone, people in other aircraft or on the ground could get hurt in case of an accident or an unscheduled landing. The way safety is regulated must be proportional to the operational risk involved.\nRules should be simple and performance based, to allow a small start-up company or individuals to start low-risk, low-altitude operations under minimal rules and to develop, with light-touch risk-based regulation, similar to the modern product safety regulations applied in other sectors. Higher risk operations would be gradually subject to more stringent regulations or operational limitations. At the other end of the spectrum, where the operational risk is highest, such as with large drones operating alongside manned aircraft, the regulation will need to be quite similar to that applying to manned aviation, with strict standards on the design, manufacturing, maintenance and operation of drones, as well as on the training of drone pilots and maintenance personnel.\n\n2. EU rules for the safe provision of drone services need to be developed now.\nSafety rules, including on remote pilot and operator qualifications, should be developed at the European level by the European Aviation Safety Agency, building on the experience developed in the EU Member States. The essential requirements should be harmonised at the global level to the maximum extent possible, and full use should be made of the established cooperation in the Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned Systems (JARUS) and at ICAO, and should be completed by international industry standard setting bodies. Important efforts need to be put into resourcing these activities, especially JARUS, in order to ensure that the progressive risk-based approach is consistent with what is done in the rest of the world.\nThis basic regulatory framework should be put in place without delay, in order to help the private sector to take well-informed investment decisions, and to provide a basic set of rules for the many operators who are increasingly eager to begin providing services. The European Aviation Safety Agency should consult stakeholders by the middle of next year on the regulatory framework for the operations of drones and on concrete regulatory proposals for low-risk operations. By the end of next year the Agency will use the results of the consultation to propose a position on these matters. The proposal for the revision of the basic European Safety Regulation, which the European Commission has announced for next year, should contain the necessary new provisions and essential requirements for the progressive risk-based regulation of drones, based on the Agency's recommendations.\n\n3. Technologies and standards need to be developed for the full integration of drones in the European airspace.\nThe success of drone activities and safety regulations also depends on the financial effort to develop and validate key missing technologies and the ensuing required standards. Both industry and public authorities stressed the need for adequate investment in the technologies that are required to integrate drones into the aviation system \u2014 the SESAR programme. Clean Sky and other initiatives should complete the SESAR investments. That would create spin-offbenef1ts for traditional aviation and so frame the future of \ufb02ying.\n\n4. Public acceptance is key to the growth of drone services.\nThe respect of citizens\u2019 fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, must be guaranteed. Many drone services involve data-gathering such as \ufb01lming, etc. The responsible authorities, such as the national and European Data Protection Authorities, should develop the necessary guidelines and monitoring mechanisms to ensure the full respect of existing protection rules, including in relation to drones. Rules need to clarify what is acceptable and what is not, and they require to be properly enforced.\nDrones may cause nuisances and negative externalities, such as noise. These nuisances need to be addressed, possibly at the local level, to maintain public acceptance.\nDrones also pose potential security risks. The design of drones can and should take into account those risks by using methods such as cyber-defence or geofencing. However, the malicious use of drones cannot be entirely prevented by design or operational restrictions. It is the task of the national police and justice systems to address those risks.\n5. The operator of a drone is responsible for its use.\nWhen a drone service is delivered in prohibited airspace, in an unsafe manner, or for illegal purposes, the authorities should be able to act and hold the operator accountable. Where lacking, this will need to be clarified in national law. Moreover, in order to enforce responsibility, it will be necessary for drones to have at all times an identi\ufb01able owner or operator. The regulator should seek the least bureaucratic way to achieve this. For instance, the mandating of electronic identity chips on drones - \u201cIDrones\u201d - as is today envisaged in some states, could be formalised through a safety rule, which would contribute to the effective implementation of privacy and security requirements. Standardised web-portals in the Member States for the registration of operators and their operations could be another solution. The involved authorities need to work closely together.\nDrone accidents will happen. Member States should clarify the applicable insurance and third party liability regime and monitor the compensation mechanisms for potential victims. The establishment of compensation funds to cover victims of accidents caused by uninsured drone users, as used in the motor insurance sector, could be envisaged. Reporting on drone incidents should be integrated into the overall incident reporting requirements. Systematic and coherent incident reporting will improve safety and will be instrumental for insurance companies in their risk analysis on which third party liability insurance premiums are based.\nTo allow a short reaction time, the development of drone services and drone technologies needs close monitoring. To this end, the EU should establish an easy access for SMEs to information required for drone manufacturing and service provision, together with an observatory to keep track of the growing number of operations in Europe and the evolution of innovation. This monitoring will permit informed decisions relative to the establishment of priorities for future legislation. It will also help regulators to learn from experience and verify that the rules are fit for purpose, namely to ensure that new technologies and drone services can develop in full respect of the required high levels of safety, security, privacy and environmental protection. An annual progress report should be published.\nThe European aviation community gathered in Riga today is committed to working together on the basis of these principles to allow businesses to provide drone services everywhere in Europe as from 20XX-1 onwards.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe demand for drone services is steadily increasing, with the potential to generate significant economic growth and societal benefits, as recognised in the 20XX-2 EU Aviation Strategy, and more recently in the SESAR Drones Outlook Study and Warsaw Declaration on drones. In order to realise this potential, the Declaration calls for \u201curgent action on the airspace dimension, in particular the development of the concept of U-space\u201d. Ultimately, U-space will enable complex drone operations with a high degree of automation to take place in all types of operational environments, including urban areas. U-space must be flexible enough to encourage innovation, support the development of new businesses and facilitate the overall growth of the European drone services market while properly addressing, at EU level, safety and security issues, respecting the privacy of citizens, and minimising the environmental impact. This blueprint outlines the proposed vision for U-space and how it could be rolled out. Rather than providing a definitive solution, this blueprint provides the basis to better define the way drones will operate in Europe in the future. \nWhat is U-space?\nU-space is a set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for large numbers of drones. These services rely on a high level of digitalisation and automation of functions, whether they are on board the drone itself, or are part of the ground-based environment. U-space provides an enabling framework to support routine drone operations, as well as a clear and effective interface to manned aviation.\n\nWhat are the key principles of U-space?\nThe delivery of U-space relies upon the following key principles:\nTo ensure the safety of all airspace users operating in the U-space framework, as well as people on the ground.\nTo provide a scalable, flexible and adaptable system that can respond to changes in demand, volume, technology, business models and applications, while managing the interface with manned aviation.\nTo enable high-density operations with multiple automated drones under the supervision of fleet operators.\nTo guarantee equitable and fair access to airspace for all users.\nTo enable competitive and cost-effective service provision at all times, supporting the business models of drone operators.\nTo minimise deployment and operating costs by leveraging, as much as possible, existing aeronautical services and infrastructure, including GNSS as well as those from other sectors, such as mobile communication services.\nTo accelerate deployment by adopting technologies and standards from other sectors where they meet the needs of U-space.\nTo follow a risk-based and performance-driven approach when setting up appropriate requirements for safety, security [including cyber-security] and resilience [including failure mode management], while minimising environmental impact and respecting the privacy of citizens, including data protection.\n\n\nHow will U-space operate?\nSubject to compliance with applicable regulations, operational limitations and technical requirements linked to the operation of the drone, U-space facilitates any kind of mission, from the delivery of goods, aerial work, and search and rescue, to more complex future applications such as urban air mobility.\nU-space services are offered to both private [leisure and professional] and public users of drones, for all types of missions. Some services will meet privacy and security needs expressed by the relevant authorities. In addition, the criticality of these services will lead to the establishment of performance requirements for both structural elements and service delivery, covering, for example, safety, security, availability, continuity and resilience.\nThe U-space framework comprises an extensive and scalable range of services relying on agreed EU standards and delivered by service providers. These services do not replicate the function of ATC \u201a as known in ATM, but deliver key services to organise the safe and efficient operation of drones and ensure a proper interface with manned aviation, ATC and relevant authorities. They may include the provision of data, supporting services for drone operators such as flight planning assistance and more structured services such as tracking or capacity management.\n\n\n\nUnmanned aircraft (most people call them \u2018drones\u2019) is a sector of aviation that is developing very fast and has a great potential for producing new jobs and growth. The term \u2018unmanned aircraft\u2019 includes very large aircraft similar in size and complexity to manned aircraft,\u00a0but also very small consumer electronics aircraft. Especially the smaller ones are increasingly being used in the Europe Union (EU), but under a fragmented regulatory framework. Basic national safety rules apply, but the rules differ across the EU and a number of key safeguards are not addressed in a coherent way.\nOn request by the European Commission, Member States and other stakeholders, the Agency started to develop a proposals for an operation centric, proportionate, risk- and performance-based regulatory framework for all unmanned aircraft (UA) establishing three categories with different safety requirements, proportionate to the risk:\n\u2018open\u2019 (low risk) is a UA operation category that, considering the risks involved, does not require a prior authorisation by the competent authority before the operation takes place;\n\u2018specific\u2019 (medium risk) is a UA operation category that, considering the risks involved, requires an authorisation by the competent authority before the operation takes place and takes into account the mitigation measures identified in an operational risk assessment, except for certain standard scenarios where a declaration by the operator is sufficient;\n\u2018certified\u2019 (high risk) is a UA operation category that, considering the risks involved, requires the certification of the UA, a licensed remote pilot and an operator approved by the competent authority, in order to ensure an appropriate level of safety.\nFollowing the publication of an advance NPA, a Technical Opinion, a \u2018Prototype\u2019 regulation\u00a0was drafted for the \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018specific\u2019 categories. The \u2018Prototype\u2019 regulation was published proposing actual rules providing the necessary clarity, notably on what are the responsibilities of the Member States and what is the flexibility offered to them.\nA significant number of comments has been received and together with the significant inputs provided by an expert group have been taken into account to further develop the regulation text leading to the publication of an NPA. An impact assessment details analysis of several potential options considered. The analysis benefited also from feedback provided by stakeholders.\nThe NPA has taken into consideration the developments in the international arena e.g. work done in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO); in the Joint Authorities for the Rulemaking of Unmanned Systems (JARUS) and of course in the USA (Federal Aviation Administration- FAA).\nThe proposal provides a framework to safely operate drones while allowing this industry to remain agile, to innovate and continue to grow. The risk posed to people on the ground and to other aircraft as well as privacy, security and data protection issues created by such drones are also taken into account.\nThe proposed regulation defines the technical and operational requirements for the drones. Technical requirements refer for example to the remote identification of drones.\u00a0 Operational requirements refer among others to geofencing; a system that ensures the drones does not enter a prohibited zone. The proposal also addresses the pilots\u2019 qualifications. Furthermore, drone operators will have to register themselves, except when they operate drones lighter than 250g.\nThis proposal is breaking new grounds by combining Product legislation and Aviation legislation. Indeed, design requirements for small drones will be implemented by using the legislation relative to making products available on the market (the well-known CE marking). The standard CE mark will be accompanied by the identification of the class of the drone (from C0 to C4) and by a do\u2019s and don\u2019ts leaflet that will be found in all drone boxes. Based on the drone class an operator will know in which area he can operate and what competence is required.\nThe proposal allows a high degree of flexibility for EASA Member States; they will be able to define zones in their territory where either drones operations are prohibited or restricted (for example to protect sensitive areas), or where certain requirements are alleviated.\nFor operations that pose higher risks, an operational risk assessment will define the requirements that the operator needs to comply before flying the drone.\nThe proposal also provides special alleviations for people flying model aircraft - which are also drones \u2013 to recognise the good safety records in aero modelling identifying 3 options:\nMember States may issue a special authorisation to model clubs and associations defining deviations from the UAS regulation;\nOperations can be conducted in specific zones designated by Member States; or\nOperations can be conducted in the open category according the operational limitations defined for one of the Subcategory (A3)\nEASA will submit a final Opinion to the European Commission at the end of 20XX, which will take into account the feedback, received to this proposal.\n\n\n\n\nDrone Alliance Europe (DAE) is a coalition of leading technology companies representing the commercial drone industry before European political leaders, regulators, and other industry stakeholders, as well as international regulatory and advisory bodies.\nThe commercial drone industry has the potential to bring tremendous economic growth, jobs, innovation, and broad societal benefits. Amid exponential industry growth and opportunity, it is critical to pursue a forward-leaning regulatory framework to fully realise this potential and further promote European leadership in research, production, and application of this technology.\nOur Mission\nThe Alliance leverages the experience and perspectives of member companies throughout the policymaking process to expedite the safe and widespread integration of commercial drones into European airspace. Together, the DAE represents a strong, united voice working toward the expeditious development of:\nProportionate, risk-based, pan-European regulations that facilitate a clear path toward authorization of expanded operations throughout the continent, including fully autonomous and beyond visual line of sight operations\nA low-cost, interoperable unmanned traffic management (UTM) framework\u00a0that promotes the safe and secure integration of expanded drone operations essential to industry growth\nA regulatory framework that embraces the flexible use of licensed, unlicensed, and spectrum sharing opportunities for drone technology necessary to support safe integration, innovation, and technology leadership throughout the Digital Single Market\n\nOur Members\n\n\n\nSecure your drone \u2013 or pay the price \nBy Nick Gibbons - cyber security expert and partner at BLM\nDrone technology offers many benefits \u2013 from the potential for speedy Amazon deliveries from the sky, to saving lives, as witnessed recently when the Lochaber mountain rescue team used one to find a hurt climber. \nBut on the flip side, there are risks associated with aerial technology, such as drone jacking or hacking. \nTypically, when the conversation moves to the subject of drone-jacking, people immediately envisage a Hollywood-style breach of national security, probably in or around the White House before Will Smith leaps in to save the day. \nHowever, attacks on this technology represent very real risks for the growing number of businesses using drones, such as engineers surveying buildings and infrastructure, e-commerce giants sending deliveries or companies gathering surveillance for insurance claims. \nEarlier this year, Amazon announced an expansion to its research and development team in Cambridge. This will see 400 technology specialists fine-tuning the technology behind delivery drones. Despite claims that such deliveries are \u201cpipe dreams\u201d, there is a growing market for commercial drone technology, and with this comes a growing risk of drone-jacking. \nLast November, a report from security software company McAfee predicted cybercriminals will soon turn their attention to targeting drones, particularly those used for law enforcement, filming and deliveries. \nDrones without adequate security in place will be vulnerable to hacks, as well as physical attacks. The report speculates 20XX will see an increase in availability, via the dark web, of pre-packaged software and toolkits for hacking drones. In these cases, hacking of the drone itself or its supporting software may result in either physical misuse or data breaches. Hacking for the physical diversion of a drone carries the potential for personal injury or property damage, actual theft of the drone or indeed, the item it was carrying. \nTheft of data is another real risk, particularly if the drone contains personal or sensitive information, whether customer data included for delivery purposes or footage collected via an attached camera. \nThe loss of data via drone-jacking leaves businesses and authorities with many privacy concerns, especially with the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into force in May 20XX+1. In recent years, there have been a raft of data breaches resulting in an invasion of privacy for customers of companies, including TalkTalk and Camelot, and breaches of the GDPR could entail fines of up to four per cent of a company\u2019s global turnover. \nAttacks are becoming more sophisticated and wide-reaching; recently, we saw the extensive damage hackers can unleash with the WannaCry cyber attack bringing organisations across the globe to a standstill. \nIf cyber attacks start targeting drones, drone-jacking could leave businesses and their customers equally exposed with regards to personal and commercial data, and the prospect of big fines levied by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. \nAlthough the use of drones is already, to an extent, covered by a range of laws and regulations, including the Data Protection Act, more specific, targeted legislation is necessary, as are effective insurance products for organisations using drones. This is especially important with the European Commission predicting full integration of drones into European airspace by 20XX+10. \nThe UK Government is clearly live to the emerging risks of drone technology. Following a recent consultation exercise, a registration system is to be launched for drones weighing 250g or more. The UK Government is considering the best legislative option for introducing the new rules. \nCurrently, a combination of existing insurance policies are required to cover risks associated with drone technology. As the risk of electronic theft of sensitive data rises, the market for specialised policies grows. \nIn the case of drone-jacking, it would be wise for a business to consider cyber risk policies available for first and third parties. These can provide protection against business interruption, reputational risks, loss or theft of third party corporate data notification expenses and the payment of compensation to individuals affected by security or privacy breaches. Care should be taken, however, when selecting a particular cyber policy, including detailed discussions with a specialised brokers. \nSo while drones have life-saving potential for Scotland\u2019s mountain rescue teams and a business may find investing in the technology an attractive proposition, an outbreak of drone-jacking could be hugely costly. It is critical that companies consider the security breaches drone-jacking could leave them open to, and invest in the appropriate protection \u2013 just in case Will Smith is not available. \n\n\n\nDrone flew 'within wingspan' of plane approaching Heathrow \nRob Davies\nA drone flew within 20 metres of a plane on the approach to Heathrow, while another shocked pilots by appearing at 3,000 metres (10,000ft), a monthly update on near-misses has revealed.\nCommercial jet pilots reported two \u201ccategory A\u201d incidents, the most serious class of near-miss, involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), known as drones.\nThe latest report comes amid concern that drone near-misses are on the rise, potentially posing a threat to recreational and commercial planes.\nIn one case, an Airbus A320 pilot on the approach to Heathrow in October last year spotted a drone within just 20 metres, or \u201cpossibly within the wingspan\u201d of the aircraft.\nInvestigators concluded that the drone had flown so close to the passenger jet that \u201cprovidence had played a major part in the aircraft not colliding\u201d. They also noted that the \u201cblue and disc-like\u201d craft appeared to be custom-made, rather than a commercially available model.\nIn the second of two serious UAV incidents, an A320 pilot taking off from Heathrow saw a red drone overhead, about 50 metres away from his right wing at about 1,000 metres.\nThe pilot noted that there would have been a \u201cdistinct possibility of damage\u201d had a collision occurred, while investigators found that \u201ca collision had only been narrowly avoided and chance had played a major part\u201d.\nA third drone sighting, deemed a less serious category B incident, involved an unmanned aircraft at an altitude that surprised pilots, who had \u201cno time to react\u201d.\nThe UK Airprox Board, which issues monthly reports on the threat of mid-air collisions, reported a pilot saying: \u201cWas that a drone? At 10,000 ft!\u201d\nLarge drones are not permitted to fly above 120 metres, or close to airports.\nThe \u201clarge drone\u201d, which appeared to be stationary, came within 60 metres (200ft) of the aircraft, a distance deemed less risky than the category A incidents, but nonetheless \u201ca situation where safety was not assured\u201d.\nA fourth drone sighting, involving a pilot on a sightseeing trip near the Binevenagh mountain in Northern Ireland, was deemed to be at the lowest level of risk, category E.\nIn all four cases, police were alerted but the operator of the drone could not be traced.\nMinisters are considering measures to enforce registration of all new drones so they can be better monitored, while the Department for Transport is also reviewing drone safety.\nPilots believe a collision with an airliner could be catastrophic and that the impact of a drone strike on a light plane or helicopter would almost certainly bring it down.\nThe British Airline Pilots Association has warned that the number of incidents could soar as people fly drones received as Christmas presents, often with little or no handling experience or understanding of the rules.\nThere have been 59 drone near-misses reported in the past 12 months. Drone sightings were among 21 incidents reported to the UK Airprox Board, six of which were deemed to be in the most serious category.\nAmong the other category A incidents was a near-miss in which a model aircraft was flown close to a Chinook military helicopter coming in to land at RAF Benson.\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Commission demands EU laws on drones after string of near-misses with aeroplanes\n, Brussels correspondent \n30 September 20XX-1 \u2022 8:20am \nThe European Commission has called for fresh impetus behind its stalled plans for EU-wide regulation of drones, after a string of near-misses with airplanes across Europe last year.\nThere were more than 1,200 \u201csafety occurrences\" involving drones in Europe last year, including several involving planes, the commission, the EU\u2019s civil service, said.\nOn April 22, a drone passed by the wingtip of  with 156 passengers as it came\u00a0into land at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. In 2016 three planes narrowly missed drones near Heathrow airport,  for tougher .\n\u201cIf we don't move fast enough, the near misses between drones and airplanes could one day have disastrous consequences,\u201d Violeta Bulc, the EU\u2019s transport commissioner said.\n\u201cDrones offer tremendous opportunities for new services and businesses,\u201d she said, \u201cbut safety always comes first\u201d.\nThe commission drafts laws, which are then amended separately by the European Parliament and national governments sitting in the Council of Ministers.

But now drones, and their makers, are navigating a third path between hobbyists and warfare into the industrial world, threatening a shake-up of the burgeoning $6bn industry. \nNew uses for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to give drones their technical name, are emerging almost daily: delivering packages, pizzas and blood; surveying mines; pre-emptive firefighting; even collecting whale snot to help conserve the mammals. \n\u201cWe are developing the UAV into a means of production,\u201d said Paul Xu, vice-president of DJI, at a conference in Shenzhen last month. His company has given China undisputed leadership in the sector, with its 70 per cent market share of non-military drones \nHowever, if Shenzhen-based DJI, valued at $8bn-$10bn at its last funding round in 20XX-2, is to keep that lead, it will need to adapt to new market dynamics. \nThe industry dismisses talk of \u201cpeak\u201d consumer drone, but few expect that part of the business to maintain its heady growth rates. Outside China, casualties abound: in California, Lily Robotics shut up shop in January, while 3D Robotics switched its focus to software and Parrot, of France, axed jobs. New entrants are cut from an altogether different cloth, with industrial and tech groups, including Qualcomm, Intel and Boeing hovering over the space. \nRegulators too are braced for change, as the industry lobbies for more openings. In a first step, the US Federal Aviation Administration, in effect, opened the skies to commercial drones a year ago, with limited safety rules covering the sector. \nSince the FAA rule changes, says Michael Perry, director of strategic partnerships at DJI, the enterprise industry has been scaling up rapidly, encouraged by the more certain regulatory environment. \u201cBefore we had conversations [with businesses] but then they said: \u2018How will my legal team deal with this?\u2019 The last thing we want is vagaries. People won\u2019t invest if they aren\u2019t sure.\u201d \nDJI, the creation of Frank Wang, a radio-controlled helicopter enthusiast from Hangzhou who transformed his boyhood hobby into a company with sales of $1.5bn, is now looking into areas ranging from agriculture to eliminating mosquitoes. \n\u201cPersonal drone vendors are now aggressively trying to position themselves in the commercial market,\u201d says Gerald Van Hoy, senior research analyst at Gartner, although the firm says the 3m drones it expects to be shipped this year will still be overwhelmingly for the consumer market. These figures are up 39 per cent on 20XX-1 and should translate into revenues of $6bn.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n16.06.20XX\n \n1. BACKGROUND \nThe demand for drone services is steadly incresing, with the potential to generate significant economic growth adn societal benefits. The EC is committed to deliver on its ambitious Aviation Strategy and unleash the full potential of drones in 20XX+2, therefore requiring an effective legislative framework able to foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing related concerns such as safety. In this context, on the 16th of June 20XX the Single European Sky Air traffic management Research Joint Udertaking published a blueprint, which intends to make drone use in low-level airspace safe, secure and enivronmentally friendly. \n \n2. UNMANNED OR REMOTELY PILOTED VEHICLES IN THE EUROPEAN AIRSPACE: OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS\nThere are opportunities and threats related to unmanned or remotely piloted vehicles. The main opportunities refer to:\na. Sustaniable jobs and new prospects for growth both for manufacturing industry and potentially all involved sectors of society;\nb. New services and applications, while performing existing services in a more affordable and environmentally friendly way.\nFor instance, drones can be been used to help in the fight against crime, searching for missing people, gathering evidence from road traffic investigations. They can also be used in other domains, such as to shoot weddings, Hollywood movies, to deliver packages, pizzas and blood. As a matter of fact, new uses for drones are emerging on a daily basis. \n \nOn the other side, the main threats refers to the followind areas:\na. The respect of citizens' fundamental rights, such as the right of privacy and the protection of personal data.\nb. The integration of drones into the aviation system.\nc. Drones may cause noice.\nd. Security risks.\nThese risks shall be adequately taken into account in order to lower them at an accetable level. In addition, considering that a zero risk level is not reachable, national police and justice should also be involved to adress those risks. \n \n3.  BLUEPRINT FOR DRONE USE IN LOW-LEVEL AIRSPACE\nThe blueprint for drone use in low-level airspace intends to make their use safe, secure and environmentally friendly.\nThe airspace refers to altitudes of up to 150 meter The set of new services and specific procedures designed to support safe, efficient and secure access to airspace for large number of drones is also also called \"U-space\". \nThe key principles of the U-space are as follows:\na. to ensure safety of all airspace users, as well as people on the ground. \nb. to provide a scalable, flexible and adaptable system.\nc. to enable high-density operations.\nd. to guarantee equitable and fair access to airspace for all users.\ne. to enable competitive and cost-effective service provision at all times.\nf. to minimise deployment and operating costs by leveraging on existing aeronautical services and infrastructure.\ng. to accelerate deployment by adopting techonologies and standard from other sectors where they meet the needs of U-space.\nh. to follow a risk-based and performance-driven approach in relation to safety, security and resilience, while minimising environmental impact and respecting the privacy of citizens.\nTne U-space will operate subject to compliance with applicable regulations, operational limitations and technical requirements linked to the operation of the drone. U-space services are offered to both private and public users of drones. The U-space framework comprises an extensive and scalable range of services relying on agreed EU standards and delivered by service providers. \nThe goal is to have wihtin 20XX+2 already in place basic services like registration, e-identification and geo-fencing. \n \n4. NEXT STEPS\nTo enanche the opportunities related to the drones, different safery requirements shall be furhter development and included in the legislation. They could be related to the risk level.\n \n5.

As AI systems increase in capability and as they are integrated more fully into societal infrastructure, the implications of losing meaningful control over them become more concerning. New research efforts are aimed at re-conceptualizing the foundations of the field to make AI systems less reliant on explicit, and easily mis specified, objectives. A particularly visible danger is that AI can make it easier to build machines that can spy and even kill at scale. But there are many other important and subtler dangers at present.\nTechno-Solutionism\nOne of the most pressing dangers of AI is techno-solutionism, the view that AI can be seen as a panacea when it is merely a tool. As we see more AI advances, the temptation to apply AI decision-making to all societal problems increases. But technology often creates larger problems in the process of solving smaller ones. For example, systems that streamline and automate the application of social services can quickly become rigid and deny access to migrants or others who fall between the cracks. \nWhen given the choice between algorithms and humans, some believe algorithms will always be the less-biased choice. Yet, in 2018, Amazon found it necessary to discard a proprietary recruiting tool because the historical data it was trained on resulted in a system that was systematically biased against women. Automated decision-making can often serve to replicate, exacerbate, and even magnify the same bias we wish it would remedy.\nIndeed, far from being a cure-all, technology can actually create feedback loops that worsen discrimination. Recommendation algorithms, like Google\u2019s page rank, are trained to identify and prioritize the most \u201crelevant\u201d items based on how other users engage with them. As biased users feed the algorithm biased information, it responds with more bias, which informs users\u2019 understandings and deepens their bias, and so on. Because all technology is the product of a biased system, techno-solutionism\u2019s flaws run deep: a creation is limited by the limitations of its creator.\nDangers of Adopting a Statistical Perspective on Justice\nAutomated decision-making may produce skewed results that replicate and amplify existing biases. A potential danger, then, is when the public accepts AI-derived conclusions as certainties. This determinist approach to AI decision-making can have dire implications in both criminal and healthcare settings. AI-driven approaches like PredPol, software originally developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and UCLA that purports to help protect one in 33 US citizens, predict when, where, and how crime will occur. A 2016 case study of a US city noted that the approach disproportionately projected crimes in areas with higher populations of non-white and low-income residents. When datasets disproportionately represent the lower power members of society, flagrant discrimination is a likely result.\nSentencing decisions are increasingly decided by proprietary algorithms that attempt to assess whether a defendant will commit future crimes, leading to concerns that justice is being outsourced to software. As AI becomes increasingly capable of analyzing more and more factors that may correlate with a defendant's perceived risk, courts and society at large may mistake an algorithmic probability for fact. This dangerous reality means that an algorithmic estimate of an individual\u2019s risk to society may be interpreted by others as a near certainty\u2014a misleading outcome even the original tool designers warned against. Even though a statistically driven AI system could be built to report a degree of credence along with every prediction, there\u2019s no guarantee that the people using these predictions will make intelligent use of them. Taking probability for certainty means that the past will always dictate the future.\nThere is an aura of neutrality and impartiality associated with AI decision-making in some corners of the public consciousness, resulting in systems being accepted as objective even though they may be the result of biased historical decisions or even blatant discrimination. All data insights rely on some measure of interpretation. As a concrete example, an audit of a resume-screening tool found that the two main factors it associated most strongly with positive future job performance were whether the applicant was named Jared, and whether he played high school lacrosse. Undesirable biases can be hidden behind both the opaque nature of the technology used and the use of proxies, nominally innocent attributes that enable a decision that is fundamentally biased. An algorithm fueled by data in which gender, racial, class, and ableist biases are pervasive can effectively reinforce these biases without ever explicitly identifying them in the code.\u00a0\nWithout transparency concerning either the data or the AI algorithms that interpret it, the public may be left in the dark as to how decisions that materially impact their lives are being made. Lacking adequate information to bring a legal claim, people can lose access to both due process and redress when they feel they have been improperly or erroneously judged by AI systems. Large gaps in case law make applying Title VII\u2014the primary existing legal framework in the US for employment discrimination\u2014to cases of algorithmic discrimination incredibly difficult. These concerns are exacerbated by algorithms that go beyond traditional considerations such as a person\u2019s credit score to instead consider any and all variables correlated to the likelihood that they are a safe investment. A statistically significant correlation has been shown among Europeans between loan risk and whether a person uses a Mac or PC and whether they include their name in their email address\u2014which turn out to be proxies for affluence. Companies that use such attributes, even if they do indeed provide improvements in model accuracy, may be breaking the law when these attributes also clearly correlate with a protected class like race. Loss of autonomy can also result from AI-created \u201cinformation bubbles\u201d that narrowly constrict each individual\u2019s online experience to the point that they are unaware that valid alternative perspectives even exist.\nDisinformation and Threat to Democracy\nAI systems are being used in the service of disinformation on the internet, giving them the potential to become a threat to democracy and a tool for fascism. From deepfake videos to online bots manipulating public discourse by feigning consensus and spreading fake news, there is the danger of AI systems undermining social trust. The technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage. Disinformation poses serious threats to society, as it effectively changes and manipulates evidence to create social feedback loops that undermine any sense of objective truth. The debates about what is real quickly evolve into debates about who gets to decide what is real, resulting in renegotiations of power structures that often serve entrenched interests. \nDiscrimination and Risk in the Medical Setting\nWhile personalized medicine is a good potential application of AI, there are dangers. Current business models for AI-based health applications tend to focus on building a single system\u2014for example, a deterioration predictor\u2014that can be sold to many buyers. However, these systems often do not generalize beyond their training data. Even differences in how clinical tests are ordered can throw off predictors, and, over time, a system\u2019s accuracy will often degrade as practices change. Clinicians and administrators are not well-equipped to monitor and manage these issues, and insufficient thought given to the human factors of AI integration has led to oscillation between mistrust of the system (ignoring it) and over-reliance on the system (trusting it even when it is wrong), a central concern of the 2016 AI100 report.\nThese concerns are troubling in general in the high-risk setting that is healthcare, and even more so because marginalized populations\u2014those that already face discrimination from the health system from both structural factors (like lack of access) and scientific factors (like guidelines that were developed from trials on other populations)\u2014may lose even more. Today and in the near future, AI systems built on machine learning are used to determine post-operative personalized pain management plans for some patients and in others to predict the likelihood that an individual will develop breast cancer. AI algorithms are playing a role in decisions concerning distributing organs, vaccines, and other elements of healthcare. Biases in these approaches can have literal life-and-death stakes.\nIn 2019, the story broke that Optum, a health-services algorithm used to determine which patients may benefit from extra medical care, exhibited fundamental racial biases. The system designers ensured that race was precluded from consideration, but they also asked the algorithm to consider the future cost of a patient to the healthcare system. While intended to capture a sense of medical severity, this feature in fact served as a proxy for race: controlling for medical needs, care for Black patients averages $1,800 less per year.\nNew technologies are being developed every day to treat serious medical issues. A new algorithm trained to identify melanomas was shown to be more accurate than doctors in a recent study, but the potential for the algorithm to be biased against Black patients is significant as the algorithm was trained using majority light-skinned groups. The stakes are especially high for melanoma diagnoses, where the five-year survival rate is 17 percentage points less for Black Americans than white. While technology has the potential to generate quicker diagnoses and thus close this survival gap, a machine-learning algorithm is only as good as its data set. An improperly trained algorithm could do more harm than good for patients at risk, missing cancers altogether or generating false positives. As new algorithms saturate the market with promises of medical miracles, losing sight of the biases ingrained in their outcomes could contribute to a loss of human biodiversity, as individuals who are left out of initial data sets are denied adequate care. While the exact long-term effects of algorithms in healthcare are unknown, their potential for bias replication means any advancement they produce for the population in aggregate\u2014from diagnosis to resource distribution\u2014may come at the expense of the most vulnerable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulatory framework proposal on artificial intelligence \nThe Commission is proposing the first-ever legal framework on AI, which addresses the risks of AI and positions Europe to play a leading role globally. \n\n\u00a9 gorodenkoff - iStock Getty Images Plus\nThe regulatory proposal aims to provide AI developers, deployers and users with clear requirements and obligations regarding specific uses of AI. At the same time, the proposal seeks to reduce administrative and financial burdens for business, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\nThe proposal is part of a wider AI package, which also includes the updated Coordinated Plan on AI. Together, the Regulatory framework and Coordinated Plan will guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses when it comes to AI. And they will strengthen uptake, investment and innovation in AI across the EU.\nWhy do we need rules on AI?\nThe proposed AI regulation ensures that Europeans can trust what AI has to offer. While most AI systems pose limited to no risk and can contribute to solving many societal challenges, certain AI systems create risks that we must address to avoid undesirable outcomes.\nFor example, it is often not possible to find out why an AI system has made a decision or prediction and taken a particular action. So, it may become difficult to assess whether someone has been unfairly disadvantaged, such as in a hiring decision or in an application for a public benefit scheme.\nAlthough existing legislation provides some protection, it is insufficient to address the specific challenges AI systems may bring.\nThe proposed rules will:\naddress risks specifically created by AI applications.\npropose a list of high-risk applications.\nset clear requirements for AI systems for high-risk applications.\ndefine specific obligations for AI users and providers of high-risk applications.\npropose a conformity assessment before the AI system is put into service or placed on the market.\npropose enforcement after such an AI system is placed in the market.\npropose a governance structure at European and national level.\nA risk-based approach\n\nThe Regulatory Framework defines 4 levels of risk in AI:\nUnacceptable risk\nHigh risk\nLimited risk\nMinimal or no risk\nUnacceptable risk\nAll AI systems considered a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods and rights of people will be banned, from social scoring by governments to toys using voice assistance that encourages dangerous behaviour.\nHigh risk\nAI systems identified as high-risk include AI technology used in:\ncritical infrastructures (e.g., transport), that could put the life and health of citizens at risk.\neducational or vocational training, that may determine the access to education and professional course of someone\u2019s life (e.g., scoring of exams).\nsafety components of products (e.g., AI application in robot-assisted surgery).\nemployment, management of workers and access to self-employment (e.g., CV-sorting software for recruitment procedures).\nessential private and public services (e.g., credit scoring denying citizens opportunity to obtain a loan).\nlaw enforcement that may interfere with people\u2019s fundamental rights (e.g., evaluation of the reliability of evidence).\nmigration, asylum, and border control management (e.g., verification of authenticity of travel documents).\nadministration of justice and democratic processes (e.g., applying the law to a concrete set of facts).\nHigh-risk AI systems will be subject to strict obligations before they can be put on the market:\nadequate risk assessment and mitigation systems.\nhigh quality of the datasets feeding the system to minimize risks and discriminatory outcomes.\nlogging of activity to ensure traceability of results.\ndetailed documentation providing all information necessary on the system and its purpose for authorities to assess its compliance.\nclear and adequate information to the user.\nappropriate human oversight measures to minimize risk.\nhigh level of robustness, security and accuracy.\nAll remote biometric identification systems are considered high risk and subject to strict requirements. The use of remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes is, in principle, prohibited.\nNarrow exceptions are strictly defined and regulated, such as such as when necessary to search for a missing child, to prevent a specific and imminent terrorist threat or to detect, locate, identify, or prosecute a perpetrator or suspect of a serious criminal offence.\nSuch use is subject to authorization by a judicial or other independent body and to appropriate limits in time, geographic reach and the data bases searched.\nLimited risk\nLimited risk refers to AI systems with specific transparency obligations. When using AI systems such as chatbots, users should be aware that they are interacting with a machine so they can take an informed decision to continue or step back.\nMinimal or no risk\nThe proposal allows the free use of minimal-risk AI. This includes applications such as AI-enabled video games or spam filters. Most AI systems currently used in the EU fall into this category.\n\n\n\nHow does it all work in practice for providers of high-risk AI systems?\nOnce an AI system is on the market, authorities oversee market surveillance, users ensure human oversight and monitoring, and providers have a post-market monitoring system in place. Providers and users will also report serious incidents and malfunctioning.\nFuture-proof legislation\nAs AI is a fast-evolving technology, the proposal has a future-proof approach, allowing rules to adapt to technological change. AI applications should remain trustworthy even after they have been placed on the market. This requires ongoing quality and risk management by providers.\n\n\n\n\nThe 5 biggest risks of generative AI, according to an expert \nAI makes our lives easier in many different ways. However, these benefits can come with costs. \n\n\n\nWritten by Sabrina Ortiz, Associate Editor on April 25, 20XX\n\nGenerative AIs, such as ChatGPT, have revolutionized how we interact with and view AI. Activities like writing, coding, and applying for jobs have become much easier and quicker. With all the positives, however, there are some pretty serious risks.\nA major concern with AI is trust and security, which has even caused some countries to completely ban ChatGPT as a whole or to reconsider policy around AI to protect users from harm.\u00a0\nAccording to Gartner analyst Avivah Litan, some of the biggest risks of generative AI concern trust and security and include hallucinations, deepfakes, data privacy, copyright issues, and cybersecurity problems.\n1. Hallucinations\nHallucinations refer to the errors that AI models are prone to make because, although they are advanced, they are still not human and rely on training and data to provide answers.\u00a0\nIf you've used an\u00a0AI chatbot, then you have probably experienced these hallucinations through a misunderstanding of your prompt or a blatantly wrong answer to your question.\nLitan says the training data can lead to biased or factually incorrect responses, which can be a serious problem when people are relying on these bots for information.\u00a0\n\"Training data can lead to biased, off base or wrong responses, but these can be difficult to spot, particularly as solutions are increasingly believable and relied upon,\" says Litan.\u00a0\n2. Deepfakes\nA deepfake uses generative AI to create videos, photos, and voice recordings that are fake but take the image and likeness of another individual.\u00a0\nPerfect examples are the AI-generated viral photo of Pope Francis in a puffer jacket or the\u00a0AI-generated Drake and the Weeknd song, which garnered hundreds of thousands of streams.\u00a0\n\"These fake images, videos and voice recordings have been used to attack celebrities and politicians, to create and spread misleading information, and even to create fake accounts or take over and break into existing legitimate accounts,\" says Litan.\u00a0\nLike hallucinations, deepfakes can contribute to the massive spread of fake content, leading to the spread of misinformation, which is a serious societal problem.\u00a0\n3. Data privacy\nPrivacy is also a major concern with generative AI since user data is often stored for model training. This concern was the overarching factor that pushed\u00a0Italy to ban ChatGPT, claiming OpenAI was not legally authorized to gather user data.\u00a0\n\"Employees can easily expose sensitive and proprietary enterprise data when interacting with generative AI chatbot solutions,\" says Litan. \"These applications may indefinitely store information captured through user inputs, and even use information to train other models -- further compromising confidentiality.\"\nLitan highlights that, in addition to compromising user confidentiality, the stored information also poses the risk of \"falling into the wrong hands\" in an instance of a security breach.\n4. Cybersecurity\nThe advanced capabilities of generative AI models, such as coding, can also fall into the wrong hands, causing cybersecurity concerns.\n\"In addition to more advanced social engineering and phishing threats, attackers could use these tools for easier malicious code generation,\" says Litan.\u00a0\nLitan says even though vendors who offer generative AI solutions typically assure customers that their models are trained to reject malicious cybersecurity requests, these suppliers don't equip end users with the ability to verify all the security measures that have been implemented.\u00a0\n5. Copyright issues\nCopyright is a big concern because generative AI models are trained on massive amounts of internet data that is used to generate an output.\u00a0\nThis process of training means that works that have not been explicitly shared by the original source can then be used to generate new content.\u00a0\nCopyright is a particularly thorny issue for\u00a0AI-generated art\u00a0of any form, including photos and music.\u00a0\nTo create an image from a prompt, AI-generating tools, such as\u00a0DALL-E, will refer back to the large database of photos they were trained on. The result of this process is that the final product might include aspects of an artist's work or style that are not attributed to them.\u00a0\nSince the exact works that generative AI models are trained on are not explicitly disclosed, it is hard to mitigate these copyright issues.\u00a0\nWhat's next?\nDespite the many risks associated to generative AI, Litan doesn't think that organizations should stop exploring the technology. Instead, they should create an enterprise-wide strategy that targets AI trust, risk, and security management.\u00a0\n\"AI developers must urgently work with policymakers, including new regulatory authorities that may emerge, to establish policies and practices for generative AI oversight and risk management,\" says Litan.\u00a0\n \n\nWhat is generative AI?\nIn simple terms, generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence in which computer algorithms are used to generate outputs that resemble human-created content, be it text, images, graphics, music, computer code or otherwise.\nIn generative AI, algorithms are designed to learn from training data that includes examples of the desired output. By analyzing the patterns and structures within the training data, generative AI models can produce new content that shares characteristics with the original input data. In doing so, generative AI has the capacity to generate content that appears authentic and human-like.\nHow does generative AI work?\nGenerative AI is based on machine learning processes inspired by the inner workings of the human brain, known as neural networks. Training the model involves feeding algorithms large amounts of data, which serves as the foundation for the AI model to learn from. This can consist of text, code, graphics, or any other type of content relevant to the task at hand.\nOnce the training data has been collected, the AI model analyzes the patterns and relationships within the data to understand the underlying rules governing the content. The AI model continuously fine-tunes its parameters as it learns, improving its ability to simulate human-generated content. The more content the AI model generates, the more sophisticated and convincing its outputs become.\nExamples of generative AI\nGenerative AI has made significant advancements in recent years, with several tools capturing the public attention and creating a stir amongst content creators. Big tech companies have also jumped on the bandwagon, with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others all lining up their own generative AI tools.\nDepending on the application, generative AI tools may rely on an input prompt that guides it towards producing a desired outcome \u2014 think ChatGPT and DALL-E 2.\nSome of the most notable examples of generative AI tools include:\nChatGPT: Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is an AI language model that can generate human-like text based on given prompts.\nDALL-E 2: Another generative AI model from OpenAI, DALL-E is designed to create images and artwork based on text-based prompts.\nMidjourney: Developed by San Francisco-based research lab Midjourney Inc., Midjourney interprets text prompts and context to produce visual content, like DALL-E 2.\nGitHub Copilot: An AI-powered coding tool created by GitHub and OpenAI, GitHub Copilot suggests code completions for users of development environments like Visual Studio and JetBrains.\nBenefits of generative AI\nThe most compelling advantage generative AI proposes is efficiency, in that it can enable businesses to automate specific tasks and focus their time, energy and resources on more important strategic objectives. This often results in lower labor costs and an increase in operational efficiency.\nGenerative AI can offer additional advantages to businesses and entrepreneurs, including:\nEasily customizing or personalizing marketing content.\nGenerating new ideas, designs, or content.\nWriting, checking, and optimizing computer code.\nDrafting templates for essays or articles.\nEnhancing customer support with chatbots and virtual assistants.\nFacilitating data augmentation for machine learning models.\nAnalyzing data to improve decision-making.\nStreamlining research and development processes.\nUse cases of generative AI\nDespite generative AI still being in its relative infancy, the technology has already found a firm foothold in various applications and industries.\nIn content creation, for instance, generative AI can produce text, images and even music, assisting marketers, journalists, and artists with their creative processes. In customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can provide more personalized assistance and reduce response times while reducing the burden on customer service agents.\nOther uses of generative AI include:\nHealthcare: Generative AI is used in medicine to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs, saving time and money in research.\nMarketing: Advertisers use generative AI to craft personalized campaigns and adapt content to consumers\u2019 preferences.\nEducation: Some educators use generative AI models to develop customized learning materials and assessments that cater to students\u2019 individual learning styles.\nFinance: Financial analysts use generative AI to examine market patterns and predict stock market trends.\nEnvironment: Climate scientists employ generative AI models to predict weather patterns and simulate the effects of climate change.\nDangers and limitations of generative AI\nIt\u2019s important to note that generative AI presents numerous issues requiring attention. One major concern is its potential for spreading misinformation or malicious or sensitive content, which could cause profound damage to people and businesses \u2014 and potentially pose a threat to national security.\nThese risks have not escaped policymakers. In April 20XX, the European Union proposed new copyright rules for generative AI that would require companies to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop these tools. Hopes are that such rules will encourage transparency and ethics in AI development, while minimizing any misuse or infringement of intellectual property. This should also offer some protection to content creators whose work may be unwittingly mimicked or plagiarized by generative AI tools.\nThe automation of tasks by generative AI could also affect the workforce and contribute to job displacement, requiring impacted employees to reskill or upskill. Additionally, generative AI models can unintentionally learn and amplify biases present in training data, leading to problematic outputs that perpetuate stereotypes and harmful ideologies.\nChatGPT, Bing AI and Google Bard have all drawn controversy for producing incorrect or harmful outputs since their launch, and these concerns must be addressed as generative AI evolves, particularly given the difficulty of scrutinizing the sources used to train AI models.\nGenerative AI vs. general AI\nGenerative AI and general AI represent different aspects of artificial intelligence. Generative AI focuses on creating new content or ideas based on existing data. It has specific applications and is a subset of AI that excels at solving particular tasks.\nGeneral AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, broadly refers to the concept of AI systems that possess human-like intelligence. General AI is still the stuff of science fiction; it represents an imagined future stage of AI development in which computers are able to think, reason and act autonomously.\nIs generative AI the future?\nIt depends on who you ask, but many experts believe that generative AI has a significant role to play in the future of various industries. The capabilities of generative AI have already proven valuable in areas like content creation, software development and healthcare, and as the technology continues to evolve, so too will its applications and use cases.\nThat said, the future of generative AI is inextricably tied to addressing the potential risks it presents. Ensuring AI is used ethically by minimizing biases, enhancing transparency and accountability and upholding data governance will be critical as the technology progresses. At the same time, striking a balance between automation and human involvement will be crucial for maximizing the benefits of generative AI while mitigating any potential negative consequences on the workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTOCKHOLM, April 27 (Reuters) - Companies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems, according to an early EU agreement that could pave the way for the world's first comprehensive laws governing the technology.\nThe European Commission began drafting the AI Act nearly two years ago to regulate emerging artificial intelligence technology, which underwent a boom in investment and popularity following the release of OpenAI's AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT.\nMembers of the European Parliament agreed to push the draft through to the next stage, the trilogue, during which EU lawmakers and member states will thrash out the final details of the bill.\nUnder the proposals, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level: from minimal through to limited, high, and unacceptable. Areas of concern could include biometric surveillance, spreading misinformation or discriminatory language.\nWhile high-risk tools will not be banned, those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations.\nCompanies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney, will also have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems.\nThis provision was a late addition drawn up within the past two weeks, according to a source familiar with discussions. Some committee members initially proposed banning copyrighted material being used to train generative AI models altogether, the source said, but this was abandoned in favour of a transparency requirement.\n\"Against conservative wishes for more surveillance and leftist fantasies of over-regulation, parliament found a solid compromise that would regulate AI proportionately, protect citizens' rights, as well as foster innovation and boost the economy,\" said Svenja Hahn, a European Parliament deputy.\nMacquarie analyst Fred Havemeyer said the EU's proposal was \"tactful\" rather than a \"ban first, and ask questions later\" approach proposed by some.\n\"The EU has been on the frontier of regulating AI technology,\" he told Reuters.\nRACE TO MARKET\nMicrosoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI provoked awe and anxiety around the world when it unveiled ChatGPT late last year. The chatbot became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100 million monthly active users in a matter of weeks.\nThe ensuing race among tech companies to bring generative AI products to market concerned some onlookers, with Twitter-owner Elon Musk backing a proposal to halt development of such systems for six months. Shortly after signing the letter, the Financial Times reported Musk was planning to launch his own startup to rival OpenAI.\n\n\nSharon Goldman\n@sharongoldman\n\nDecember 5, 20XX-1\n\nThe hidden danger of ChatGPT and generative AI | The AI Beat\nSince OpenAI launched its early demo of ChatGPT last Wednesday, the tool already has over a million users, according to CEO Sam Altman \u2014\u00a0a milestone, he points out, that took GPT-3 nearly 24 months to get to and DALL-E over 2 months.\u00a0\nThe \u201cinteractive, conversational model,\u201d based on the company\u2019s GPT-3.5 text-generator, certainly has the tech world in full swoon mode. Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, tweeted that \u201cChatGPT is one of those rare moments in technology where you see a glimmer of how everything is going to be different going forward.\u201d Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham tweeted that \u201cclearly something big is happening.\u201d Alberto Romero, author of The Algorithmic Bridge, calls it \u201cby far, the best chatbot in the world.\u201d And even Elon Musk weighed in, tweeting that ChatGPT is \u201cscary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI.\u201d\u00a0\nBut there is a hidden problem lurking within ChatGPT: That is, it quickly spits out eloquent, confident responses that often sound plausible and true even if they are not.\u00a0\nChatGPT can sound plausible even if its output is false.\nLike other generative large language models, ChatGPT makes up facts. Some call it \u201challucination\u201d or \u201cstochastic parroting,\u201d but these models are trained to predict the next word for a given input, not whether a fact is correct or not.\u00a0\nSome have noted that what sets ChatGPT apart is that it is so darn good at making its hallucinations sound reasonable.\u00a0\nTechnology analyst Benedict Evans, for example, asked ChatGPT to \u201cwrite a bio for Benedict Evans.\u201d The result, he tweeted, was \u201cplausible, almost entirely untrue.\u201d\u00a0\nMore troubling is the fact that there are obviously an untold number of queries where the user would only know if the answer was untrue if they already knew the answer to the posed question.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s what Arvind Narayanan, a computer science professor at Princeton, pointed out in a tweet: \u201cPeople are excited about using ChatGPT for learning. It\u2019s often very good. But the danger is that you can\u2019t tell when it\u2019s wrong unless you already know the answer. I tried some basic information security questions. In most cases the answers sounded plausible but were in fact BS.\u201d\u00a0\nFact-checking generative AI\nBack in the waning days of print magazines in the 2000s, I spent several years as a fact-checker for publications including GQ and Rolling Stone. Each fact had to include authoritative primary or secondary sources \u2014 and Wikipedia was frowned upon.\u00a0\nFew publications have staff fact-checkers anymore, which puts the onus on reporters and editors to make sure they get their facts straight \u2014\u00a0especially at a time when misinformation already moves like lightning across social media, while search engines are constantly under pressure to surface verifiable information and not BS.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s certainly why Stack Overflow, the Q&A site for coders and programmers, has temporarily banned users from sharing ChatGPT responses.\u00a0\nAnd if StackOverflow can\u2019t keep up with misinformation due to AI, it\u2019s hard to imagine others being able to manage a tsunami of potential AI-driven BS. As Gary Marcus tweeted, \u201cIf StackOverflow can\u2019t keep up with plausible but incorrect information, what about social media and search engines?\u201d \nAnd while many are salivating at the idea that LLMs like ChatGPT could someday replace traditional search engines, others are strongly pushing back.\u00a0\nEmily Bender, professor of linguistics at the University of Washington, has long pushed back on this notion.\u00a0\nShe recently emphasized again that LLMs are \u201cnot fit\u201d for search \u2014\u201d both because they are designed to just make sh** up and because they don\u2019t support information literacy.\u201d She pointed to a paper she co-authored on the topic published in March.\u00a0\nIs it better for ChatGPT to look right? Or be right?\u00a0\nBS is obviously something that humans have perfected over the centuries. And ChatGPT and other large language models have no idea what it means, really, to \u201cBS.\u201d But OpenAI made this weakness very clear in its blog announcing the demo and explained that fixing it is \u201cchallenging,\u201d saying:\u00a0\n\u201cChatGPT sometimes writes plausible sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Fixing this issue is challenging, as: (1) during RL [reinforcement learning] training, there\u2019s currently no source of truth; (2) training the model to be more cautious causes it to decline questions that it can answer correctly; and (3) supervised training misleads the model because the ideal answer depends on what the model knows, rather than what the human demonstrator knows.\u201d\u00a0\nSo, it\u2019s clear that OpenAI knows perfectly well that ChatGPT is filled with BS under the surface. They never meant the technology to offer up a source of truth.\u00a0\nBut the question is: Are human users okay with that?\u00a0\nUnfortunately, they might be. If it sounds good, many humans may think that\u2019s good enough. And, perhaps, that\u2019s where the real danger lies beneath the surface of ChatGPT.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBy JAKOB HANKE VELA\nSend tips here | Tweet\u00a0@HankeVela | Listen to Playbook and view in your browser\nLABELING AI CONTENT\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \nTODAY: EU PUSHES FOR \u2018AI LABEL\u2019 TO FIGHT DEEPFAKES: Brussels wants to prevent artificial intelligence from blurring the lines between fact and fiction \u2014 and will today ask companies for the first time ever to come up with a label to identify AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation, officials tell Playbook.\nBrave new world: Generative AI is making breathtaking advances \u2014 from writing texts and code to creating ever more realistic pictures and videos \u2014 which will have enormous consequences not just for the future of society and work, but for politics, Commission officials reckon. \nBalenc-ai-ga: The fake images of the Pope and famous politicians wearing a Balenciaga coat that went viral earlier this year have clearly spooked them \u2014 and they now want to label such deepfakes.\nFake porn: \u201cToday it is mostly still a game, but tomorrow you could see a fake porn with a candidate,\u201d one official who is working on the file but was not authorized to speak on the record told Playbook, referring to AI-generated images of politicians. \nRace to regulate: The Commission (the EU\u2019s executive, which proposes and enforces laws) \u2014 has proposed an AI Act to regulate high-risk applications and ban the most dangerous ones. But even before that act enters into force, the Commission will urge industry to cut down on trickery by labeling AI-generated work.\nHappening today: Commission VP for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton will meet representatives of 40-odd organizations that have signed up to the EU\u2019s Code of Practice against disinformation. They include Microsoft, Google, Meta, TikTok, Twitch and smaller companies \u2014 but not Twitter, which has left the code \u2014 as well as NGOs.\nDisinformation risks: \u201cI will ask the signatories to create a dedicated and separate track within the code\u201d to deal with disinformation generated by Artificial Intelligence, Jourov\u00e1 told Playbook. \u201cIt should \u2026 aim to identify the specific disinformation risks presented by generative AI and take appropriate measures to address them.\u201d\nEU pushes for safeguards: How does Brussels want the companies to tackle the risks? \u201cSignatories who integrate generative AI into their services like Bingchat for Microsoft, Bard for Google should build in necessary safeguards that these services cannot be used by malicious actors to generate disinformation,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 said.\nClear labels: \u201cSignatories who have services with a potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation should in turn put in place technology to recognize such content and clearly label this to users.\u201d\nMore about this label: Two officials working on the file told Playbook the label should apply to all AI-generated material that can be used to create disinformation, including text, images, audio and video.\nVoluntary \u2014 for now: It wouldn\u2019t be mandatory, given that it would be part of the voluntary Code of Practice. However, the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act (DSA). Obligations on labeling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament, and the Commission, one official said.\nHow can companies do this? \u201cThey can develop, and they probably already have tools to check whether an image was AI-generated or not,\u201d the first official said.\nPlaybook wonders: Given how easy it is for AI to proliferate across jurisdictions, will such a technology ever be able to identify all deepfakes \u2014 or won\u2019t we, on the contrary, one day need some chain of custody procedure for authentic images that can be used, for example, as evidence in court?\nStay tuned: Jourov\u00e1 will present her initiative at a press point tomorrow at 11:15 a.m.\nSPEAKING OF WHICH: While the Commission is calling on others to do more, it was recently\u00a0reported\u00a0that it awarded and signed a \u20ac3.7 million\u00a0tender\u00a0to help analyze issues like disinformation, foreign meddling in elections and global threats from a French firm that\u2019s mired in controversy.\nAvisa Partners\u00a0has previously been\u00a0accused\u00a0of manipulating information in France and working for authoritarian regimes. The company was\u00a0recently\u00a0at the center of a controversy as the organizer of a cybersecurity forum boycotted by the\u00a0French armed forces ministry\u00a0and several\u00a0government officials.\u00a0More\u00a0here\u00a0for our Pro Cybersecurity subscribers.\nLooking into this:\u00a0The Commission is looking into the allegations and \u201cis in contact with French counterparts to seek more clarity on those claim[s],\u201d Peter Stano, the Commission\u2019s spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy, told my POLITICO Pro Technology colleagues. The EU executive is \u201cclosely monitoring the implementation of this project,\u201d he added.\u00a0\nJean Tillinac, from Avisa Partners,\u00a0told my Pro Tech colleagues that the bid was \u201cdefended by a team of seasoned experts from our Strategic Intelligence Division\u201d doing research and which was different from the \u201cDigital Communications Division\u201d facing criticism.\n\n\n\nAnnex I \u2013 Glossary of Terms\nAlgorithm: a formula given to a computer for it to complete a task (i.e., a set of rules for a computer)\u00a0\nArtificial intelligence: a subset of computer science that deals with computer systems performing tasks with similar, equal, or superior intelligence to that of a human (e.g., decision-making, object classification and detection, speech recognition and translation)\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI): also known as strong AI, AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that is considered human-like, and still in its preliminary stages (more of a hypothetical existence in present day)\nArtificial narrow intelligence (ANI): also known as weak AI, ANI is a type of artificial intelligence that can only focus on one task or problem at a given time (e.g., playing a game against a human competitor).

Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data, and then generate new data that has similar characteristics. \nGenetic algorithm: an algorithm based on principles of genetics that is used to find solutions efficiently and quickly to difficult problems.\nMachine learning (ML): focuses on developing programs that access and use data on their own, leading machines to learn for themselves and improve from learned experiences.\nNatural language processing (NLP): helps computers process, interpret, and analyze human language and its characteristics by using natural language data.\u00a0\nPattern recognition: automated recognition of patterns found in data.\nReinforcement learning: a machine learning method where the reinforcement algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and is then penalized or rewarded based on decisions it makes.\nStrong AI: see artificial general intelligence (AGI)\u00a0\u00a0\nStructured data: clearly defined data with easily searchable patterns.\nSupervised learning: a type of machine learning where output datasets teach machines to generate desired outcomes or algorithms (akin to a teacher-student relationship).\nTransfer learning: a system that uses previously learned data and applies it to a new set of tasks.\nTuring Test: a test created by computer scientist Alan Turing (1950) to see if machines could exhibit intelligence equal to or indistinguishable from that of a human.\nUnstructured data: data without easily searchable patterns (e.g., audio, video, social media content)\nUnsupervised learning: a type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained with information that is neither classified nor labeled, thus allowing the algorithm to act without guidance.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nWHAT IS GAI\nGenerative AI is a sub field of articial intelligence, where computer algoritms are used to create output that seems to be created by human being. Some example of results can be, text, image, video and coding line.\nThese algoritms are fed with training data, which includes some example of desired output. Algoritms analyse the structure of those training data and can create new outputs, which can seem unique and made by human.\nGAI is a machine learning process, it continues to fine tunes itself, the more contents are created the more sophisticated and convincing outcome will become.\n \nGAI POTENTIAL BENEFITS\nGenerative Artificial intelligence has several benefit, infact it can be used to improve efficiencies within business environment but also in private life. GAI can carry out specific and easy task and give more time to focus on more strategic and important activities.\nIn business environment it is mainly used as previously said to improve efficiencies, this means lower labour cost. It is used in several field, such as:\n-Healthcare to enhance discoveries and elaborate data,\n-Finance to study and predict stock market trends,\n-Education to produce training material and assessment that fit better to students,\n-Marketing to create new content which are dedicated to specific customers,\n-Environment to predict weather analysing data.\n-in several field can be help in customer support, with virtual assistent and in general to analyse data and improving deicsion making process.\nBenefits are visible and even if it is a relatively new discover, lot of companies and people are relying on it.\n \nWHAT ARE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH GAI\nUnfortunately since it a relatively new discovery, GAI needs still to be discover fully and the related dangers with it. \nDangers can be the spread of misinformation, malicious or sensitive contents, which can bring damage to people and business, some of them can be:\n-Hallucination, sometimes GAI can produce wrong output and it can be a problem for people that are relying too much on it, we need to remember that it is still a machine and does not have the same understanding of human being.\n-Deepfakes, as explained before GAI can be used to produce fake news or fake content such as video or picture, which can harm people or businesses. i particular this can harm EU value of democracy be used to manupulate information and influence people in politics but also in their opinion.\n-Dataprivacy, GAI can be used to solve problem, for example in our business but all the information, also sensitive ones, that we give to this system are stored and can be used in different ways,\n-Cybersecurity, related to previous point some of the information given can be use to harm business or people.\n-Copyright, GAI is fed with training data, but it can include data from different source and authors, for this reason the output result can be a mix of all those information and the output can be a violation of copyright.\n-Wokforce, finally another fundamental point is that increasing efficiencies will usually lead to reduce the workforce to improve company copetitiveness. in this way workers can lose their job and they will be in the position of rebuild themself and upskill in order to compete with AI or find alternatives jobs.\nHOW EU WANTS TO ADDRESS GAI DANGERS?\nBased on previous brief list of danges, it is needed to find a way to regulate GAI to use this powerful tool in the safetiest possible way.\nEU is proposiing the first ever legal framework on AI, in the AI package it is also include the Coordinated plan on AI. These two measures will guarantee safety and fundamental right for people and business and will reduce the cost and investment to access this technology especially for SMEs.\nThis proposal will set clear requirements and obligations regarding specific use of AI.\nIn April 20XX European Union proposed a new Copyright rules for generative EU, which would require companies to disclose any compyright material used to develop those tools. The aim to use these rules to improve transparency and ethics, and minimizing misues and infringment of copyrights.\nFurthermore, based on regulatory framewoek all tool will be classified based on associated risk which can be, Unacceptable risk, High risk, Limited risk and Minimal risk.\nPart oEuropean Union wants also to address directly the problem of segregation of fact and fiction, for this reason, EU wants to ask company to label all contents that are created by GAI.\nThe proposal is to labe all AI materials created to tackle the proble of misinformation about text, images, video or audio. For now this labelling it is not mandatory but discussion is ongoing among EU countries, Parliament and commission.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 5.0\n\n"}]}

Remember that the candidate deserves to be treated with respect. Equally, be aware that they are probably writing in a language that is not their primary tongue. Use simple, understandable language in your feedback.\n    - Be specific and constructive. Avoid general statements like \"good job\" or \"needs improvement.\" Focus on specific areas where the candidate can improve, such as content management, grammar, sentence structure, clarity, and organization.\n    - Be timely. Give the candidate feedback as soon as possible so that they have time to learn from their mistakes and apply your feedback suggestions. \n\n    \n    Providing Your Feedback\n    - Comment on the content and style elements, not the author.\n    - Be objective, concise, and clear in your feedback.\n    - Provide feedback that assists the author to improve.\n    \n    Specific Feedback\n    When providing feedback on a written text, you should consider the following areas:\n    - Content: Does the text address all of the required elements of the assignment? Is the information accurate and well-researched? Are there adequate quantitative data provided? Are sources attributed and appropriately referenced? Isn\u2019t referencing too much (no need for academic-style citation), or too limited? \n    - Grammar and mechanics: Check for errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.\n    - Sentence structure: Look for sentences that are too long or complex, or that are not well structured.

As AI systems increase in capability and as they are integrated more fully into societal infrastructure, the implications of losing meaningful control over them become more concerning. New research efforts are aimed at re-conceptualizing the foundations of the field to make AI systems less reliant on explicit, and easily mis specified, objectives. A particularly visible danger is that AI can make it easier to build machines that can spy and even kill at scale. But there are many other important and subtler dangers at present.\nTechno-Solutionism\nOne of the most pressing dangers of AI is techno-solutionism, the view that AI can be seen as a panacea when it is merely a tool. As we see more AI advances, the temptation to apply AI decision-making to all societal problems increases. But technology often creates larger problems in the process of solving smaller ones. For example, systems that streamline and automate the application of social services can quickly become rigid and deny access to migrants or others who fall between the cracks. \nWhen given the choice between algorithms and humans, some believe algorithms will always be the less-biased choice. Yet, in 2018, Amazon found it necessary to discard a proprietary recruiting tool because the historical data it was trained on resulted in a system that was systematically biased against women. Automated decision-making can often serve to replicate, exacerbate, and even magnify the same bias we wish it would remedy.\nIndeed, far from being a cure-all, technology can actually create feedback loops that worsen discrimination. Recommendation algorithms, like Google\u2019s page rank, are trained to identify and prioritize the most \u201crelevant\u201d items based on how other users engage with them. As biased users feed the algorithm biased information, it responds with more bias, which informs users\u2019 understandings and deepens their bias, and so on. Because all technology is the product of a biased system, techno-solutionism\u2019s flaws run deep: a creation is limited by the limitations of its creator.\nDangers of Adopting a Statistical Perspective on Justice\nAutomated decision-making may produce skewed results that replicate and amplify existing biases. A potential danger, then, is when the public accepts AI-derived conclusions as certainties. This determinist approach to AI decision-making can have dire implications in both criminal and healthcare settings. AI-driven approaches like PredPol, software originally developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and UCLA that purports to help protect one in 33 US citizens, predict when, where, and how crime will occur. A 2016 case study of a US city noted that the approach disproportionately projected crimes in areas with higher populations of non-white and low-income residents. When datasets disproportionately represent the lower power members of society, flagrant discrimination is a likely result.\nSentencing decisions are increasingly decided by proprietary algorithms that attempt to assess whether a defendant will commit future crimes, leading to concerns that justice is being outsourced to software. As AI becomes increasingly capable of analyzing more and more factors that may correlate with a defendant's perceived risk, courts and society at large may mistake an algorithmic probability for fact. This dangerous reality means that an algorithmic estimate of an individual\u2019s risk to society may be interpreted by others as a near certainty\u2014a misleading outcome even the original tool designers warned against. Even though a statistically driven AI system could be built to report a degree of credence along with every prediction, there\u2019s no guarantee that the people using these predictions will make intelligent use of them. Taking probability for certainty means that the past will always dictate the future.\nThere is an aura of neutrality and impartiality associated with AI decision-making in some corners of the public consciousness, resulting in systems being accepted as objective even though they may be the result of biased historical decisions or even blatant discrimination. All data insights rely on some measure of interpretation. As a concrete example, an audit of a resume-screening tool found that the two main factors it associated most strongly with positive future job performance were whether the applicant was named Jared, and whether he played high school lacrosse. Undesirable biases can be hidden behind both the opaque nature of the technology used and the use of proxies, nominally innocent attributes that enable a decision that is fundamentally biased. An algorithm fueled by data in which gender, racial, class, and ableist biases are pervasive can effectively reinforce these biases without ever explicitly identifying them in the code.\u00a0\nWithout transparency concerning either the data or the AI algorithms that interpret it, the public may be left in the dark as to how decisions that materially impact their lives are being made. Lacking adequate information to bring a legal claim, people can lose access to both due process and redress when they feel they have been improperly or erroneously judged by AI systems. Large gaps in case law make applying Title VII\u2014the primary existing legal framework in the US for employment discrimination\u2014to cases of algorithmic discrimination incredibly difficult. These concerns are exacerbated by algorithms that go beyond traditional considerations such as a person\u2019s credit score to instead consider any and all variables correlated to the likelihood that they are a safe investment. A statistically significant correlation has been shown among Europeans between loan risk and whether a person uses a Mac or PC and whether they include their name in their email address\u2014which turn out to be proxies for affluence. Companies that use such attributes, even if they do indeed provide improvements in model accuracy, may be breaking the law when these attributes also clearly correlate with a protected class like race. Loss of autonomy can also result from AI-created \u201cinformation bubbles\u201d that narrowly constrict each individual\u2019s online experience to the point that they are unaware that valid alternative perspectives even exist.\nDisinformation and Threat to Democracy\nAI systems are being used in the service of disinformation on the internet, giving them the potential to become a threat to democracy and a tool for fascism. From deepfake videos to online bots manipulating public discourse by feigning consensus and spreading fake news, there is the danger of AI systems undermining social trust. The technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage. Disinformation poses serious threats to society, as it effectively changes and manipulates evidence to create social feedback loops that undermine any sense of objective truth. The debates about what is real quickly evolve into debates about who gets to decide what is real, resulting in renegotiations of power structures that often serve entrenched interests. \nDiscrimination and Risk in the Medical Setting\nWhile personalized medicine is a good potential application of AI, there are dangers. Current business models for AI-based health applications tend to focus on building a single system\u2014for example, a deterioration predictor\u2014that can be sold to many buyers. However, these systems often do not generalize beyond their training data. Even differences in how clinical tests are ordered can throw off predictors, and, over time, a system\u2019s accuracy will often degrade as practices change. Clinicians and administrators are not well-equipped to monitor and manage these issues, and insufficient thought given to the human factors of AI integration has led to oscillation between mistrust of the system (ignoring it) and over-reliance on the system (trusting it even when it is wrong), a central concern of the 2016 AI100 report.\nThese concerns are troubling in general in the high-risk setting that is healthcare, and even more so because marginalized populations\u2014those that already face discrimination from the health system from both structural factors (like lack of access) and scientific factors (like guidelines that were developed from trials on other populations)\u2014may lose even more. Today and in the near future, AI systems built on machine learning are used to determine post-operative personalized pain management plans for some patients and in others to predict the likelihood that an individual will develop breast cancer. AI algorithms are playing a role in decisions concerning distributing organs, vaccines, and other elements of healthcare. Biases in these approaches can have literal life-and-death stakes.\nIn 2019, the story broke that Optum, a health-services algorithm used to determine which patients may benefit from extra medical care, exhibited fundamental racial biases. The system designers ensured that race was precluded from consideration, but they also asked the algorithm to consider the future cost of a patient to the healthcare system. While intended to capture a sense of medical severity, this feature in fact served as a proxy for race: controlling for medical needs, care for Black patients averages $1,800 less per year.\nNew technologies are being developed every day to treat serious medical issues. A new algorithm trained to identify melanomas was shown to be more accurate than doctors in a recent study, but the potential for the algorithm to be biased against Black patients is significant as the algorithm was trained using majority light-skinned groups. The stakes are especially high for melanoma diagnoses, where the five-year survival rate is 17 percentage points less for Black Americans than white. While technology has the potential to generate quicker diagnoses and thus close this survival gap, a machine-learning algorithm is only as good as its data set. An improperly trained algorithm could do more harm than good for patients at risk, missing cancers altogether or generating false positives. As new algorithms saturate the market with promises of medical miracles, losing sight of the biases ingrained in their outcomes could contribute to a loss of human biodiversity, as individuals who are left out of initial data sets are denied adequate care. While the exact long-term effects of algorithms in healthcare are unknown, their potential for bias replication means any advancement they produce for the population in aggregate\u2014from diagnosis to resource distribution\u2014may come at the expense of the most vulnerable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulatory framework proposal on artificial intelligence \nThe Commission is proposing the first-ever legal framework on AI, which addresses the risks of AI and positions Europe to play a leading role globally. \n\n\u00a9 gorodenkoff - iStock Getty Images Plus\nThe regulatory proposal aims to provide AI developers, deployers and users with clear requirements and obligations regarding specific uses of AI. At the same time, the proposal seeks to reduce administrative and financial burdens for business, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\nThe proposal is part of a wider AI package, which also includes the updated Coordinated Plan on AI. Together, the Regulatory framework and Coordinated Plan will guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses when it comes to AI. And they will strengthen uptake, investment and innovation in AI across the EU.\nWhy do we need rules on AI?\nThe proposed AI regulation ensures that Europeans can trust what AI has to offer. While most AI systems pose limited to no risk and can contribute to solving many societal challenges, certain AI systems create risks that we must address to avoid undesirable outcomes.\nFor example, it is often not possible to find out why an AI system has made a decision or prediction and taken a particular action. So, it may become difficult to assess whether someone has been unfairly disadvantaged, such as in a hiring decision or in an application for a public benefit scheme.\nAlthough existing legislation provides some protection, it is insufficient to address the specific challenges AI systems may bring.\nThe proposed rules will:\naddress risks specifically created by AI applications.\npropose a list of high-risk applications.\nset clear requirements for AI systems for high-risk applications.\ndefine specific obligations for AI users and providers of high-risk applications.\npropose a conformity assessment before the AI system is put into service or placed on the market.\npropose enforcement after such an AI system is placed in the market.\npropose a governance structure at European and national level.\nA risk-based approach\n\nThe Regulatory Framework defines 4 levels of risk in AI:\nUnacceptable risk\nHigh risk\nLimited risk\nMinimal or no risk\nUnacceptable risk\nAll AI systems considered a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods and rights of people will be banned, from social scoring by governments to toys using voice assistance that encourages dangerous behaviour.\nHigh risk\nAI systems identified as high-risk include AI technology used in:\ncritical infrastructures (e.g., transport), that could put the life and health of citizens at risk.\neducational or vocational training, that may determine the access to education and professional course of someone\u2019s life (e.g., scoring of exams).\nsafety components of products (e.g., AI application in robot-assisted surgery).\nemployment, management of workers and access to self-employment (e.g., CV-sorting software for recruitment procedures).\nessential private and public services (e.g., credit scoring denying citizens opportunity to obtain a loan).\nlaw enforcement that may interfere with people\u2019s fundamental rights (e.g., evaluation of the reliability of evidence).\nmigration, asylum, and border control management (e.g., verification of authenticity of travel documents).\nadministration of justice and democratic processes (e.g., applying the law to a concrete set of facts).\nHigh-risk AI systems will be subject to strict obligations before they can be put on the market:\nadequate risk assessment and mitigation systems.\nhigh quality of the datasets feeding the system to minimize risks and discriminatory outcomes.\nlogging of activity to ensure traceability of results.\ndetailed documentation providing all information necessary on the system and its purpose for authorities to assess its compliance.\nclear and adequate information to the user.\nappropriate human oversight measures to minimize risk.\nhigh level of robustness, security and accuracy.\nAll remote biometric identification systems are considered high risk and subject to strict requirements. The use of remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes is, in principle, prohibited.\nNarrow exceptions are strictly defined and regulated, such as such as when necessary to search for a missing child, to prevent a specific and imminent terrorist threat or to detect, locate, identify, or prosecute a perpetrator or suspect of a serious criminal offence.\nSuch use is subject to authorization by a judicial or other independent body and to appropriate limits in time, geographic reach and the data bases searched.\nLimited risk\nLimited risk refers to AI systems with specific transparency obligations. When using AI systems such as chatbots, users should be aware that they are interacting with a machine so they can take an informed decision to continue or step back.\nMinimal or no risk\nThe proposal allows the free use of minimal-risk AI. This includes applications such as AI-enabled video games or spam filters. Most AI systems currently used in the EU fall into this category.\n\n\n\nHow does it all work in practice for providers of high-risk AI systems?\nOnce an AI system is on the market, authorities oversee market surveillance, users ensure human oversight and monitoring, and providers have a post-market monitoring system in place. Providers and users will also report serious incidents and malfunctioning.\nFuture-proof legislation\nAs AI is a fast-evolving technology, the proposal has a future-proof approach, allowing rules to adapt to technological change. AI applications should remain trustworthy even after they have been placed on the market. This requires ongoing quality and risk management by providers.\n\n\n\n\nThe 5 biggest risks of generative AI, according to an expert \nAI makes our lives easier in many different ways. However, these benefits can come with costs. \n\n\n\nWritten by Sabrina Ortiz, Associate Editor on April 25, 20XX\n\nGenerative AIs, such as ChatGPT, have revolutionized how we interact with and view AI. Activities like writing, coding, and applying for jobs have become much easier and quicker. With all the positives, however, there are some pretty serious risks.\nA major concern with AI is trust and security, which has even caused some countries to completely ban ChatGPT as a whole or to reconsider policy around AI to protect users from harm.\u00a0\nAccording to Gartner analyst Avivah Litan, some of the biggest risks of generative AI concern trust and security and include hallucinations, deepfakes, data privacy, copyright issues, and cybersecurity problems.\n1. Hallucinations\nHallucinations refer to the errors that AI models are prone to make because, although they are advanced, they are still not human and rely on training and data to provide answers.\u00a0\nIf you've used an\u00a0AI chatbot, then you have probably experienced these hallucinations through a misunderstanding of your prompt or a blatantly wrong answer to your question.\nLitan says the training data can lead to biased or factually incorrect responses, which can be a serious problem when people are relying on these bots for information.\u00a0\n\"Training data can lead to biased, off base or wrong responses, but these can be difficult to spot, particularly as solutions are increasingly believable and relied upon,\" says Litan.\u00a0\n2. Deepfakes\nA deepfake uses generative AI to create videos, photos, and voice recordings that are fake but take the image and likeness of another individual.\u00a0\nPerfect examples are the AI-generated viral photo of Pope Francis in a puffer jacket or the\u00a0AI-generated Drake and the Weeknd song, which garnered hundreds of thousands of streams.\u00a0\n\"These fake images, videos and voice recordings have been used to attack celebrities and politicians, to create and spread misleading information, and even to create fake accounts or take over and break into existing legitimate accounts,\" says Litan.\u00a0\nLike hallucinations, deepfakes can contribute to the massive spread of fake content, leading to the spread of misinformation, which is a serious societal problem.\u00a0\n3. Data privacy\nPrivacy is also a major concern with generative AI since user data is often stored for model training. This concern was the overarching factor that pushed\u00a0Italy to ban ChatGPT, claiming OpenAI was not legally authorized to gather user data.\u00a0\n\"Employees can easily expose sensitive and proprietary enterprise data when interacting with generative AI chatbot solutions,\" says Litan. \"These applications may indefinitely store information captured through user inputs, and even use information to train other models -- further compromising confidentiality.\"\nLitan highlights that, in addition to compromising user confidentiality, the stored information also poses the risk of \"falling into the wrong hands\" in an instance of a security breach.\n4. Cybersecurity\nThe advanced capabilities of generative AI models, such as coding, can also fall into the wrong hands, causing cybersecurity concerns.\n\"In addition to more advanced social engineering and phishing threats, attackers could use these tools for easier malicious code generation,\" says Litan.\u00a0\nLitan says even though vendors who offer generative AI solutions typically assure customers that their models are trained to reject malicious cybersecurity requests, these suppliers don't equip end users with the ability to verify all the security measures that have been implemented.\u00a0\n5. Copyright issues\nCopyright is a big concern because generative AI models are trained on massive amounts of internet data that is used to generate an output.\u00a0\nThis process of training means that works that have not been explicitly shared by the original source can then be used to generate new content.\u00a0\nCopyright is a particularly thorny issue for\u00a0AI-generated art\u00a0of any form, including photos and music.\u00a0\nTo create an image from a prompt, AI-generating tools, such as\u00a0DALL-E, will refer back to the large database of photos they were trained on. The result of this process is that the final product might include aspects of an artist's work or style that are not attributed to them.\u00a0\nSince the exact works that generative AI models are trained on are not explicitly disclosed, it is hard to mitigate these copyright issues.\u00a0\nWhat's next?\nDespite the many risks associated to generative AI, Litan doesn't think that organizations should stop exploring the technology. Instead, they should create an enterprise-wide strategy that targets AI trust, risk, and security management.\u00a0\n\"AI developers must urgently work with policymakers, including new regulatory authorities that may emerge, to establish policies and practices for generative AI oversight and risk management,\" says Litan.\u00a0\n \n\nWhat is generative AI?\nIn simple terms, generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence in which computer algorithms are used to generate outputs that resemble human-created content, be it text, images, graphics, music, computer code or otherwise.\nIn generative AI, algorithms are designed to learn from training data that includes examples of the desired output. By analyzing the patterns and structures within the training data, generative AI models can produce new content that shares characteristics with the original input data. In doing so, generative AI has the capacity to generate content that appears authentic and human-like.\nHow does generative AI work?\nGenerative AI is based on machine learning processes inspired by the inner workings of the human brain, known as neural networks. Training the model involves feeding algorithms large amounts of data, which serves as the foundation for the AI model to learn from. This can consist of text, code, graphics, or any other type of content relevant to the task at hand.\nOnce the training data has been collected, the AI model analyzes the patterns and relationships within the data to understand the underlying rules governing the content. The AI model continuously fine-tunes its parameters as it learns, improving its ability to simulate human-generated content. The more content the AI model generates, the more sophisticated and convincing its outputs become.\nExamples of generative AI\nGenerative AI has made significant advancements in recent years, with several tools capturing the public attention and creating a stir amongst content creators. Big tech companies have also jumped on the bandwagon, with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others all lining up their own generative AI tools.\nDepending on the application, generative AI tools may rely on an input prompt that guides it towards producing a desired outcome \u2014 think ChatGPT and DALL-E 2.\nSome of the most notable examples of generative AI tools include:\nChatGPT: Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is an AI language model that can generate human-like text based on given prompts.\nDALL-E 2: Another generative AI model from OpenAI, DALL-E is designed to create images and artwork based on text-based prompts.\nMidjourney: Developed by San Francisco-based research lab Midjourney Inc., Midjourney interprets text prompts and context to produce visual content, like DALL-E 2.\nGitHub Copilot: An AI-powered coding tool created by GitHub and OpenAI, GitHub Copilot suggests code completions for users of development environments like Visual Studio and JetBrains.\nBenefits of generative AI\nThe most compelling advantage generative AI proposes is efficiency, in that it can enable businesses to automate specific tasks and focus their time, energy and resources on more important strategic objectives. This often results in lower labor costs and an increase in operational efficiency.\nGenerative AI can offer additional advantages to businesses and entrepreneurs, including:\nEasily customizing or personalizing marketing content.\nGenerating new ideas, designs, or content.\nWriting, checking, and optimizing computer code.\nDrafting templates for essays or articles.\nEnhancing customer support with chatbots and virtual assistants.\nFacilitating data augmentation for machine learning models.\nAnalyzing data to improve decision-making.\nStreamlining research and development processes.\nUse cases of generative AI\nDespite generative AI still being in its relative infancy, the technology has already found a firm foothold in various applications and industries.\nIn content creation, for instance, generative AI can produce text, images and even music, assisting marketers, journalists, and artists with their creative processes. In customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can provide more personalized assistance and reduce response times while reducing the burden on customer service agents.\nOther uses of generative AI include:\nHealthcare: Generative AI is used in medicine to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs, saving time and money in research.\nMarketing: Advertisers use generative AI to craft personalized campaigns and adapt content to consumers\u2019 preferences.\nEducation: Some educators use generative AI models to develop customized learning materials and assessments that cater to students\u2019 individual learning styles.\nFinance: Financial analysts use generative AI to examine market patterns and predict stock market trends.\nEnvironment: Climate scientists employ generative AI models to predict weather patterns and simulate the effects of climate change.\nDangers and limitations of generative AI\nIt\u2019s important to note that generative AI presents numerous issues requiring attention. One major concern is its potential for spreading misinformation or malicious or sensitive content, which could cause profound damage to people and businesses \u2014 and potentially pose a threat to national security.\nThese risks have not escaped policymakers. In April 20XX, the European Union proposed new copyright rules for generative AI that would require companies to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop these tools. Hopes are that such rules will encourage transparency and ethics in AI development, while minimizing any misuse or infringement of intellectual property. This should also offer some protection to content creators whose work may be unwittingly mimicked or plagiarized by generative AI tools.\nThe automation of tasks by generative AI could also affect the workforce and contribute to job displacement, requiring impacted employees to reskill or upskill. Additionally, generative AI models can unintentionally learn and amplify biases present in training data, leading to problematic outputs that perpetuate stereotypes and harmful ideologies.\nChatGPT, Bing AI and Google Bard have all drawn controversy for producing incorrect or harmful outputs since their launch, and these concerns must be addressed as generative AI evolves, particularly given the difficulty of scrutinizing the sources used to train AI models.\nGenerative AI vs. general AI\nGenerative AI and general AI represent different aspects of artificial intelligence. Generative AI focuses on creating new content or ideas based on existing data. It has specific applications and is a subset of AI that excels at solving particular tasks.\nGeneral AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, broadly refers to the concept of AI systems that possess human-like intelligence. General AI is still the stuff of science fiction; it represents an imagined future stage of AI development in which computers are able to think, reason and act autonomously.\nIs generative AI the future?\nIt depends on who you ask, but many experts believe that generative AI has a significant role to play in the future of various industries. The capabilities of generative AI have already proven valuable in areas like content creation, software development and healthcare, and as the technology continues to evolve, so too will its applications and use cases.\nThat said, the future of generative AI is inextricably tied to addressing the potential risks it presents. Ensuring AI is used ethically by minimizing biases, enhancing transparency and accountability and upholding data governance will be critical as the technology progresses. At the same time, striking a balance between automation and human involvement will be crucial for maximizing the benefits of generative AI while mitigating any potential negative consequences on the workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTOCKHOLM, April 27 (Reuters) - Companies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems, according to an early EU agreement that could pave the way for the world's first comprehensive laws governing the technology.\nThe European Commission began drafting the AI Act nearly two years ago to regulate emerging artificial intelligence technology, which underwent a boom in investment and popularity following the release of OpenAI's AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT.\nMembers of the European Parliament agreed to push the draft through to the next stage, the trilogue, during which EU lawmakers and member states will thrash out the final details of the bill.\nUnder the proposals, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level: from minimal through to limited, high, and unacceptable. Areas of concern could include biometric surveillance, spreading misinformation or discriminatory language.\nWhile high-risk tools will not be banned, those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations.\nCompanies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney, will also have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems.\nThis provision was a late addition drawn up within the past two weeks, according to a source familiar with discussions. Some committee members initially proposed banning copyrighted material being used to train generative AI models altogether, the source said, but this was abandoned in favour of a transparency requirement.\n\"Against conservative wishes for more surveillance and leftist fantasies of over-regulation, parliament found a solid compromise that would regulate AI proportionately, protect citizens' rights, as well as foster innovation and boost the economy,\" said Svenja Hahn, a European Parliament deputy.\nMacquarie analyst Fred Havemeyer said the EU's proposal was \"tactful\" rather than a \"ban first, and ask questions later\" approach proposed by some.\n\"The EU has been on the frontier of regulating AI technology,\" he told Reuters.\nRACE TO MARKET\nMicrosoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI provoked awe and anxiety around the world when it unveiled ChatGPT late last year. The chatbot became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100 million monthly active users in a matter of weeks.\nThe ensuing race among tech companies to bring generative AI products to market concerned some onlookers, with Twitter-owner Elon Musk backing a proposal to halt development of such systems for six months. Shortly after signing the letter, the Financial Times reported Musk was planning to launch his own startup to rival OpenAI.\n\n\nSharon Goldman\n@sharongoldman\n\nDecember 5, 20XX-1\n\nThe hidden danger of ChatGPT and generative AI | The AI Beat\nSince OpenAI launched its early demo of ChatGPT last Wednesday, the tool already has over a million users, according to CEO Sam Altman \u2014\u00a0a milestone, he points out, that took GPT-3 nearly 24 months to get to and DALL-E over 2 months.\u00a0\nThe \u201cinteractive, conversational model,\u201d based on the company\u2019s GPT-3.5 text-generator, certainly has the tech world in full swoon mode. Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, tweeted that \u201cChatGPT is one of those rare moments in technology where you see a glimmer of how everything is going to be different going forward.\u201d Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham tweeted that \u201cclearly something big is happening.\u201d Alberto Romero, author of The Algorithmic Bridge, calls it \u201cby far, the best chatbot in the world.\u201d And even Elon Musk weighed in, tweeting that ChatGPT is \u201cscary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI.\u201d\u00a0\nBut there is a hidden problem lurking within ChatGPT: That is, it quickly spits out eloquent, confident responses that often sound plausible and true even if they are not.\u00a0\nChatGPT can sound plausible even if its output is false.\nLike other generative large language models, ChatGPT makes up facts. Some call it \u201challucination\u201d or \u201cstochastic parroting,\u201d but these models are trained to predict the next word for a given input, not whether a fact is correct or not.\u00a0\nSome have noted that what sets ChatGPT apart is that it is so darn good at making its hallucinations sound reasonable.\u00a0\nTechnology analyst Benedict Evans, for example, asked ChatGPT to \u201cwrite a bio for Benedict Evans.\u201d The result, he tweeted, was \u201cplausible, almost entirely untrue.\u201d\u00a0\nMore troubling is the fact that there are obviously an untold number of queries where the user would only know if the answer was untrue if they already knew the answer to the posed question.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s what Arvind Narayanan, a computer science professor at Princeton, pointed out in a tweet: \u201cPeople are excited about using ChatGPT for learning. It\u2019s often very good. But the danger is that you can\u2019t tell when it\u2019s wrong unless you already know the answer. I tried some basic information security questions. In most cases the answers sounded plausible but were in fact BS.\u201d\u00a0\nFact-checking generative AI\nBack in the waning days of print magazines in the 2000s, I spent several years as a fact-checker for publications including GQ and Rolling Stone. Each fact had to include authoritative primary or secondary sources \u2014 and Wikipedia was frowned upon.\u00a0\nFew publications have staff fact-checkers anymore, which puts the onus on reporters and editors to make sure they get their facts straight \u2014\u00a0especially at a time when misinformation already moves like lightning across social media, while search engines are constantly under pressure to surface verifiable information and not BS.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s certainly why Stack Overflow, the Q&A site for coders and programmers, has temporarily banned users from sharing ChatGPT responses.\u00a0\nAnd if StackOverflow can\u2019t keep up with misinformation due to AI, it\u2019s hard to imagine others being able to manage a tsunami of potential AI-driven BS. As Gary Marcus tweeted, \u201cIf StackOverflow can\u2019t keep up with plausible but incorrect information, what about social media and search engines?\u201d \nAnd while many are salivating at the idea that LLMs like ChatGPT could someday replace traditional search engines, others are strongly pushing back.\u00a0\nEmily Bender, professor of linguistics at the University of Washington, has long pushed back on this notion.\u00a0\nShe recently emphasized again that LLMs are \u201cnot fit\u201d for search \u2014\u201d both because they are designed to just make sh** up and because they don\u2019t support information literacy.\u201d She pointed to a paper she co-authored on the topic published in March.\u00a0\nIs it better for ChatGPT to look right? Or be right?\u00a0\nBS is obviously something that humans have perfected over the centuries. And ChatGPT and other large language models have no idea what it means, really, to \u201cBS.\u201d But OpenAI made this weakness very clear in its blog announcing the demo and explained that fixing it is \u201cchallenging,\u201d saying:\u00a0\n\u201cChatGPT sometimes writes plausible sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Fixing this issue is challenging, as: (1) during RL [reinforcement learning] training, there\u2019s currently no source of truth; (2) training the model to be more cautious causes it to decline questions that it can answer correctly; and (3) supervised training misleads the model because the ideal answer depends on what the model knows, rather than what the human demonstrator knows.\u201d\u00a0\nSo, it\u2019s clear that OpenAI knows perfectly well that ChatGPT is filled with BS under the surface. They never meant the technology to offer up a source of truth.\u00a0\nBut the question is: Are human users okay with that?\u00a0\nUnfortunately, they might be. If it sounds good, many humans may think that\u2019s good enough. And, perhaps, that\u2019s where the real danger lies beneath the surface of ChatGPT.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBy JAKOB HANKE VELA\nSend tips here | Tweet\u00a0@HankeVela | Listen to Playbook and view in your browser\nLABELING AI CONTENT\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \nTODAY: EU PUSHES FOR \u2018AI LABEL\u2019 TO FIGHT DEEPFAKES: Brussels wants to prevent artificial intelligence from blurring the lines between fact and fiction \u2014 and will today ask companies for the first time ever to come up with a label to identify AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation, officials tell Playbook.\nBrave new world: Generative AI is making breathtaking advances \u2014 from writing texts and code to creating ever more realistic pictures and videos \u2014 which will have enormous consequences not just for the future of society and work, but for politics, Commission officials reckon. \nBalenc-ai-ga: The fake images of the Pope and famous politicians wearing a Balenciaga coat that went viral earlier this year have clearly spooked them \u2014 and they now want to label such deepfakes.\nFake porn: \u201cToday it is mostly still a game, but tomorrow you could see a fake porn with a candidate,\u201d one official who is working on the file but was not authorized to speak on the record told Playbook, referring to AI-generated images of politicians. \nRace to regulate: The Commission (the EU\u2019s executive, which proposes and enforces laws) \u2014 has proposed an AI Act to regulate high-risk applications and ban the most dangerous ones. But even before that act enters into force, the Commission will urge industry to cut down on trickery by labeling AI-generated work.\nHappening today: Commission VP for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton will meet representatives of 40-odd organizations that have signed up to the EU\u2019s Code of Practice against disinformation. They include Microsoft, Google, Meta, TikTok, Twitch and smaller companies \u2014 but not Twitter, which has left the code \u2014 as well as NGOs.\nDisinformation risks: \u201cI will ask the signatories to create a dedicated and separate track within the code\u201d to deal with disinformation generated by Artificial Intelligence, Jourov\u00e1 told Playbook. \u201cIt should \u2026 aim to identify the specific disinformation risks presented by generative AI and take appropriate measures to address them.\u201d\nEU pushes for safeguards: How does Brussels want the companies to tackle the risks? \u201cSignatories who integrate generative AI into their services like Bingchat for Microsoft, Bard for Google should build in necessary safeguards that these services cannot be used by malicious actors to generate disinformation,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 said.\nClear labels: \u201cSignatories who have services with a potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation should in turn put in place technology to recognize such content and clearly label this to users.\u201d\nMore about this label: Two officials working on the file told Playbook the label should apply to all AI-generated material that can be used to create disinformation, including text, images, audio and video.\nVoluntary \u2014 for now: It wouldn\u2019t be mandatory, given that it would be part of the voluntary Code of Practice. However, the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act (DSA). Obligations on labeling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament, and the Commission, one official said.\nHow can companies do this? \u201cThey can develop, and they probably already have tools to check whether an image was AI-generated or not,\u201d the first official said.\nPlaybook wonders: Given how easy it is for AI to proliferate across jurisdictions, will such a technology ever be able to identify all deepfakes \u2014 or won\u2019t we, on the contrary, one day need some chain of custody procedure for authentic images that can be used, for example, as evidence in court?\nStay tuned: Jourov\u00e1 will present her initiative at a press point tomorrow at 11:15 a.m.\nSPEAKING OF WHICH: While the Commission is calling on others to do more, it was recently\u00a0reported\u00a0that it awarded and signed a \u20ac3.7 million\u00a0tender\u00a0to help analyze issues like disinformation, foreign meddling in elections and global threats from a French firm that\u2019s mired in controversy.\nAvisa Partners\u00a0has previously been\u00a0accused\u00a0of manipulating information in France and working for authoritarian regimes. The company was\u00a0recently\u00a0at the center of a controversy as the organizer of a cybersecurity forum boycotted by the\u00a0French armed forces ministry\u00a0and several\u00a0government officials.\u00a0More\u00a0here\u00a0for our Pro Cybersecurity subscribers.\nLooking into this:\u00a0The Commission is looking into the allegations and \u201cis in contact with French counterparts to seek more clarity on those claim[s],\u201d Peter Stano, the Commission\u2019s spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy, told my POLITICO Pro Technology colleagues. The EU executive is \u201cclosely monitoring the implementation of this project,\u201d he added.\u00a0\nJean Tillinac, from Avisa Partners,\u00a0told my Pro Tech colleagues that the bid was \u201cdefended by a team of seasoned experts from our Strategic Intelligence Division\u201d doing research and which was different from the \u201cDigital Communications Division\u201d facing criticism.\n\n\n\nAnnex I \u2013 Glossary of Terms\nAlgorithm: a formula given to a computer for it to complete a task (i.e., a set of rules for a computer)\u00a0\nArtificial intelligence: a subset of computer science that deals with computer systems performing tasks with similar, equal, or superior intelligence to that of a human (e.g., decision-making, object classification and detection, speech recognition and translation)\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI): also known as strong AI, AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that is considered human-like, and still in its preliminary stages (more of a hypothetical existence in present day)\nArtificial narrow intelligence (ANI): also known as weak AI, ANI is a type of artificial intelligence that can only focus on one task or problem at a given time (e.g., playing a game against a human competitor). This is the current existing form of AI.\nArtificial neural network (ANN): a network modeled after the human brain by creating an artificial neural system via a pattern-recognizing computer algorithm that learns from, interprets, and classifies sensory data.\nBig data: large amounts of structured and unstructured data that is too complex to be handled by standard data-processing software.\nChatbots: a chat robot that can converse with a human user through text or voice commands. Utilized by e-commerce, education, health, and business industries for ease of communication and to answer user questions.\u00a0\nCognitive computing: computerized model that mimics human thought processes by data mining, NLP, and pattern recognition.\nComputer vision: when a machine processes visual input from image files (JPEGs) or camera feeds\nData mining: the process of sorting through large sets of data to identify recurring patterns while establishing problem-solving relationships.\nDeep learning: a machine learning technique that teaches computers how to learn by rote (i.e., machines mimic learning as a human mind would, by using classification techniques)\nGenerative AI: Generative artificial intelligence or generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of generating text, images, or other media in response to prompts. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data, and then generate new data that has similar characteristics. \nGenetic algorithm: an algorithm based on principles of genetics that is used to find solutions efficiently and quickly to difficult problems.\nMachine learning (ML): focuses on developing programs that access and use data on their own, leading machines to learn for themselves and improve from learned experiences.\nNatural language processing (NLP): helps computers process, interpret, and analyze human language and its characteristics by using natural language data.\u00a0\nPattern recognition: automated recognition of patterns found in data.\nReinforcement learning: a machine learning method where the reinforcement algorithm learns by interacting with its environment and is then penalized or rewarded based on decisions it makes.\nStrong AI: see artificial general intelligence (AGI)\u00a0\u00a0\nStructured data: clearly defined data with easily searchable patterns.\nSupervised learning: a type of machine learning where output datasets teach machines to generate desired outcomes or algorithms (akin to a teacher-student relationship).\nTransfer learning: a system that uses previously learned data and applies it to a new set of tasks.\nTuring Test: a test created by computer scientist Alan Turing (1950) to see if machines could exhibit intelligence equal to or indistinguishable from that of a human.\nUnstructured data: data without easily searchable patterns (e.g., audio, video, social media content)\nUnsupervised learning: a type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained with information that is neither classified nor labeled, thus allowing the algorithm to act without guidance.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nSpeaking Note to Commissioner Thierry Breton\n9 June 20XX, DG Internal Market\nTitle: The Commissions standpoint to generative AI (GAI)\n \nDefining GAI:\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) is a subfield of an artificial intelligence (AI) system. It can generate computer algorithms, texts, images, and music. GAI learns from training data that includes examples of desired output. \nExamples of GAI are:\nChatGPT is an AI language model that can generate human-like text based on given prompts.\nMidjourney interprets text prompts and context to produce images and artwork.\n \nPotential Benefits of GAI:\nGAI increases efficiancy, enables businesses to automate specific tasks and increase operational efficiency. It further customises marketing content, optimizing computer code, draft templates for all kind of written texts.\nPotential Risks of GAI:\nFive specific risks exist regarding GAI:\nHallucinations: GAI uses training data. The training data can lead to biased or incorrect responses, which is a serious probelm when people rely on it.\nDeepfakes: GAI creates videos and fotos and voice recording that may be abused to attack politicians and activits, spread misleading information. GAI may further create fake accounts and take over existing legitimate accounts. Disinformation through GAI is a serious risk for democracy. Deepfake videos and online bots may spread fake news and manipulate public discourse and social trust.\nData privacy: GAI user data is often stored for model training. Therefore, employees may easily expose sensitive and proprietary entreprise data. The GAI applications may indefinitely store information and even train other GAI models with it, further compromising confidentiality.\nCybersecurity: Computer hackers could abuse GAI applications to code computer viruse or other harmful software.\nCopyright issues: GAI models use big amounts of internet data sharing content that has not been explicitly shared by the original soruce. This is problematic for music and videos that have a copyright.\n \nOptions to address risks:\nThe EU has understood that fighting against desinformation in context of defending democracy and EU values is very important. Therefore, the European Commission proposes the first-ever regulatory framework on AI, namely the AI act, to address risks of AI and position Europe to play a leading role on AI globally. The existing legislation is not sufficient to address specific challenges AI systems may bring.\nThe new regulatory framework under the AI act defines 4 levels of risks unacceptable risk: high risk, limited risk, minimal risk. The EU lists GAI such as chatbots in the category of limited risk. In that case users need to be made aware that they are interacting with a machine so they can take an informed decision to continue or step back. \nThe regulation further proposes a conformity assessment before the AI system is put into service or placed on the market. GAI companies will have to disclose any copyright material used to develop their systems. Moreover, they will have to indentify and label AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation.\nNext steps\nThe commission propsed the AI Act to regulate high risk applications and ban most dangerous ones. But even before the act enters into force, the Commission will make it mandatory for the GAI industry to label AI generated work.\nSigning Code of Practice by big tech comapnies including Microsoft, Google, Meta and Tiktok against desinformation. The Code of Practice will ask signatories to create a dedicated track within the code to indentify specific disinformation risks by GAI and take appropriate measures to address them. The Commission plans to make the code enforcable by including a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act. Labelling AI contact may also enter the AI act.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 5.0\n\n"}]}

Remember that the candidate deserves to be treated with respect. Equally, be aware that they are probably writing in a language that is not their primary tongue. Use simple, understandable language in your feedback.\n    - Be specific and constructive. Avoid general statements like \"good job\" or \"needs improvement.\" Focus on specific areas where the candidate can improve, such as content management, grammar, sentence structure, clarity, and organization.\n    - Be timely. Give the candidate feedback as soon as possible so that they have time to learn from their mistakes and apply your feedback suggestions. \n\n    \n    Providing Your Feedback\n    - Comment on the content and style elements, not the author.\n    - Be objective, concise, and clear in your feedback.\n    - Provide feedback that assists the author to improve.\n    \n    Specific Feedback\n    When providing feedback on a written text, you should consider the following areas:\n    - Content: Does the text address all of the required elements of the assignment? Is the information accurate and well-researched? Are there adequate quantitative data provided? Are sources attributed and appropriately referenced? Isn\u2019t referencing too much (no need for academic-style citation), or too limited? \n    - Grammar and mechanics: Check for errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.\n    - Sentence structure: Look for sentences that are too long or complex, or that are not well structured.

Does the writing follow a \u2018red thread\u2019 or does it go all over the place? Does the brief require specific recommendations? If so these should be in a separate titled section.\n    - Style: What is the intended audience? (European Commission head of unit, general public, journalists, subject matter experts, others?) Is the writing style appropriate for that audience? Is its tone formal or informal? Is it concise and jargon-free (or is the jargon defined)?

As AI systems increase in capability and as they are integrated more fully into societal infrastructure, the implications of losing meaningful control over them become more concerning. New research efforts are aimed at re-conceptualizing the foundations of the field to make AI systems less reliant on explicit, and easily mis specified, objectives. A particularly visible danger is that AI can make it easier to build machines that can spy and even kill at scale. But there are many other important and subtler dangers at present.\nTechno-Solutionism\nOne of the most pressing dangers of AI is techno-solutionism, the view that AI can be seen as a panacea when it is merely a tool. As we see more AI advances, the temptation to apply AI decision-making to all societal problems increases. But technology often creates larger problems in the process of solving smaller ones. For example, systems that streamline and automate the application of social services can quickly become rigid and deny access to migrants or others who fall between the cracks. \nWhen given the choice between algorithms and humans, some believe algorithms will always be the less-biased choice. Yet, in 2018, Amazon found it necessary to discard a proprietary recruiting tool because the historical data it was trained on resulted in a system that was systematically biased against women. Automated decision-making can often serve to replicate, exacerbate, and even magnify the same bias we wish it would remedy.\nIndeed, far from being a cure-all, technology can actually create feedback loops that worsen discrimination. Recommendation algorithms, like Google\u2019s page rank, are trained to identify and prioritize the most \u201crelevant\u201d items based on how other users engage with them. As biased users feed the algorithm biased information, it responds with more bias, which informs users\u2019 understandings and deepens their bias, and so on. Because all technology is the product of a biased system, techno-solutionism\u2019s flaws run deep: a creation is limited by the limitations of its creator.\nDangers of Adopting a Statistical Perspective on Justice\nAutomated decision-making may produce skewed results that replicate and amplify existing biases. A potential danger, then, is when the public accepts AI-derived conclusions as certainties. This determinist approach to AI decision-making can have dire implications in both criminal and healthcare settings. AI-driven approaches like PredPol, software originally developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and UCLA that purports to help protect one in 33 US citizens, predict when, where, and how crime will occur. A 2016 case study of a US city noted that the approach disproportionately projected crimes in areas with higher populations of non-white and low-income residents. When datasets disproportionately represent the lower power members of society, flagrant discrimination is a likely result.\nSentencing decisions are increasingly decided by proprietary algorithms that attempt to assess whether a defendant will commit future crimes, leading to concerns that justice is being outsourced to software. As AI becomes increasingly capable of analyzing more and more factors that may correlate with a defendant's perceived risk, courts and society at large may mistake an algorithmic probability for fact. This dangerous reality means that an algorithmic estimate of an individual\u2019s risk to society may be interpreted by others as a near certainty\u2014a misleading outcome even the original tool designers warned against. Even though a statistically driven AI system could be built to report a degree of credence along with every prediction, there\u2019s no guarantee that the people using these predictions will make intelligent use of them. Taking probability for certainty means that the past will always dictate the future.\nThere is an aura of neutrality and impartiality associated with AI decision-making in some corners of the public consciousness, resulting in systems being accepted as objective even though they may be the result of biased historical decisions or even blatant discrimination. All data insights rely on some measure of interpretation. As a concrete example, an audit of a resume-screening tool found that the two main factors it associated most strongly with positive future job performance were whether the applicant was named Jared, and whether he played high school lacrosse. Undesirable biases can be hidden behind both the opaque nature of the technology used and the use of proxies, nominally innocent attributes that enable a decision that is fundamentally biased. An algorithm fueled by data in which gender, racial, class, and ableist biases are pervasive can effectively reinforce these biases without ever explicitly identifying them in the code.\u00a0\nWithout transparency concerning either the data or the AI algorithms that interpret it, the public may be left in the dark as to how decisions that materially impact their lives are being made. Lacking adequate information to bring a legal claim, people can lose access to both due process and redress when they feel they have been improperly or erroneously judged by AI systems. Large gaps in case law make applying Title VII\u2014the primary existing legal framework in the US for employment discrimination\u2014to cases of algorithmic discrimination incredibly difficult. These concerns are exacerbated by algorithms that go beyond traditional considerations such as a person\u2019s credit score to instead consider any and all variables correlated to the likelihood that they are a safe investment. A statistically significant correlation has been shown among Europeans between loan risk and whether a person uses a Mac or PC and whether they include their name in their email address\u2014which turn out to be proxies for affluence. Companies that use such attributes, even if they do indeed provide improvements in model accuracy, may be breaking the law when these attributes also clearly correlate with a protected class like race. Loss of autonomy can also result from AI-created \u201cinformation bubbles\u201d that narrowly constrict each individual\u2019s online experience to the point that they are unaware that valid alternative perspectives even exist.\nDisinformation and Threat to Democracy\nAI systems are being used in the service of disinformation on the internet, giving them the potential to become a threat to democracy and a tool for fascism. From deepfake videos to online bots manipulating public discourse by feigning consensus and spreading fake news, there is the danger of AI systems undermining social trust. The technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage. Disinformation poses serious threats to society, as it effectively changes and manipulates evidence to create social feedback loops that undermine any sense of objective truth. The debates about what is real quickly evolve into debates about who gets to decide what is real, resulting in renegotiations of power structures that often serve entrenched interests. \nDiscrimination and Risk in the Medical Setting\nWhile personalized medicine is a good potential application of AI, there are dangers. Current business models for AI-based health applications tend to focus on building a single system\u2014for example, a deterioration predictor\u2014that can be sold to many buyers. However, these systems often do not generalize beyond their training data. Even differences in how clinical tests are ordered can throw off predictors, and, over time, a system\u2019s accuracy will often degrade as practices change. Clinicians and administrators are not well-equipped to monitor and manage these issues, and insufficient thought given to the human factors of AI integration has led to oscillation between mistrust of the system (ignoring it) and over-reliance on the system (trusting it even when it is wrong), a central concern of the 2016 AI100 report.\nThese concerns are troubling in general in the high-risk setting that is healthcare, and even more so because marginalized populations\u2014those that already face discrimination from the health system from both structural factors (like lack of access) and scientific factors (like guidelines that were developed from trials on other populations)\u2014may lose even more. Today and in the near future, AI systems built on machine learning are used to determine post-operative personalized pain management plans for some patients and in others to predict the likelihood that an individual will develop breast cancer. AI algorithms are playing a role in decisions concerning distributing organs, vaccines, and other elements of healthcare. Biases in these approaches can have literal life-and-death stakes.\nIn 2019, the story broke that Optum, a health-services algorithm used to determine which patients may benefit from extra medical care, exhibited fundamental racial biases. The system designers ensured that race was precluded from consideration, but they also asked the algorithm to consider the future cost of a patient to the healthcare system. While intended to capture a sense of medical severity, this feature in fact served as a proxy for race: controlling for medical needs, care for Black patients averages $1,800 less per year.\nNew technologies are being developed every day to treat serious medical issues. A new algorithm trained to identify melanomas was shown to be more accurate than doctors in a recent study, but the potential for the algorithm to be biased against Black patients is significant as the algorithm was trained using majority light-skinned groups. The stakes are especially high for melanoma diagnoses, where the five-year survival rate is 17 percentage points less for Black Americans than white. While technology has the potential to generate quicker diagnoses and thus close this survival gap, a machine-learning algorithm is only as good as its data set. An improperly trained algorithm could do more harm than good for patients at risk, missing cancers altogether or generating false positives. As new algorithms saturate the market with promises of medical miracles, losing sight of the biases ingrained in their outcomes could contribute to a loss of human biodiversity, as individuals who are left out of initial data sets are denied adequate care. While the exact long-term effects of algorithms in healthcare are unknown, their potential for bias replication means any advancement they produce for the population in aggregate\u2014from diagnosis to resource distribution\u2014may come at the expense of the most vulnerable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulatory framework proposal on artificial intelligence \nThe Commission is proposing the first-ever legal framework on AI, which addresses the risks of AI and positions Europe to play a leading role globally. \n\n\u00a9 gorodenkoff - iStock Getty Images Plus\nThe regulatory proposal aims to provide AI developers, deployers and users with clear requirements and obligations regarding specific uses of AI. At the same time, the proposal seeks to reduce administrative and financial burdens for business, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\nThe proposal is part of a wider AI package, which also includes the updated Coordinated Plan on AI. Together, the Regulatory framework and Coordinated Plan will guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses when it comes to AI. And they will strengthen uptake, investment and innovation in AI across the EU.\nWhy do we need rules on AI?\nThe proposed AI regulation ensures that Europeans can trust what AI has to offer. While most AI systems pose limited to no risk and can contribute to solving many societal challenges, certain AI systems create risks that we must address to avoid undesirable outcomes.\nFor example, it is often not possible to find out why an AI system has made a decision or prediction and taken a particular action. So, it may become difficult to assess whether someone has been unfairly disadvantaged, such as in a hiring decision or in an application for a public benefit scheme.\nAlthough existing legislation provides some protection, it is insufficient to address the specific challenges AI systems may bring.\nThe proposed rules will:\naddress risks specifically created by AI applications.\npropose a list of high-risk applications.\nset clear requirements for AI systems for high-risk applications.\ndefine specific obligations for AI users and providers of high-risk applications.\npropose a conformity assessment before the AI system is put into service or placed on the market.\npropose enforcement after such an AI system is placed in the market.\npropose a governance structure at European and national level.\nA risk-based approach\n\nThe Regulatory Framework defines 4 levels of risk in AI:\nUnacceptable risk\nHigh risk\nLimited risk\nMinimal or no risk\nUnacceptable risk\nAll AI systems considered a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods and rights of people will be banned, from social scoring by governments to toys using voice assistance that encourages dangerous behaviour.\nHigh risk\nAI systems identified as high-risk include AI technology used in:\ncritical infrastructures (e.g., transport), that could put the life and health of citizens at risk.\neducational or vocational training, that may determine the access to education and professional course of someone\u2019s life (e.g., scoring of exams).\nsafety components of products (e.g., AI application in robot-assisted surgery).\nemployment, management of workers and access to self-employment (e.g., CV-sorting software for recruitment procedures).\nessential private and public services (e.g., credit scoring denying citizens opportunity to obtain a loan).\nlaw enforcement that may interfere with people\u2019s fundamental rights (e.g., evaluation of the reliability of evidence).\nmigration, asylum, and border control management (e.g., verification of authenticity of travel documents).\nadministration of justice and democratic processes (e.g., applying the law to a concrete set of facts).\nHigh-risk AI systems will be subject to strict obligations before they can be put on the market:\nadequate risk assessment and mitigation systems.\nhigh quality of the datasets feeding the system to minimize risks and discriminatory outcomes.\nlogging of activity to ensure traceability of results.\ndetailed documentation providing all information necessary on the system and its purpose for authorities to assess its compliance.\nclear and adequate information to the user.\nappropriate human oversight measures to minimize risk.\nhigh level of robustness, security and accuracy.\nAll remote biometric identification systems are considered high risk and subject to strict requirements. The use of remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes is, in principle, prohibited.\nNarrow exceptions are strictly defined and regulated, such as such as when necessary to search for a missing child, to prevent a specific and imminent terrorist threat or to detect, locate, identify, or prosecute a perpetrator or suspect of a serious criminal offence.\nSuch use is subject to authorization by a judicial or other independent body and to appropriate limits in time, geographic reach and the data bases searched.\nLimited risk\nLimited risk refers to AI systems with specific transparency obligations. When using AI systems such as chatbots, users should be aware that they are interacting with a machine so they can take an informed decision to continue or step back.\nMinimal or no risk\nThe proposal allows the free use of minimal-risk AI. This includes applications such as AI-enabled video games or spam filters. Most AI systems currently used in the EU fall into this category.\n\n\n\nHow does it all work in practice for providers of high-risk AI systems?\nOnce an AI system is on the market, authorities oversee market surveillance, users ensure human oversight and monitoring, and providers have a post-market monitoring system in place. Providers and users will also report serious incidents and malfunctioning.\nFuture-proof legislation\nAs AI is a fast-evolving technology, the proposal has a future-proof approach, allowing rules to adapt to technological change. AI applications should remain trustworthy even after they have been placed on the market. This requires ongoing quality and risk management by providers.\n\n\n\n\nThe 5 biggest risks of generative AI, according to an expert \nAI makes our lives easier in many different ways. However, these benefits can come with costs. \n\n\n\nWritten by Sabrina Ortiz, Associate Editor on April 25, 20XX\n\nGenerative AIs, such as ChatGPT, have revolutionized how we interact with and view AI. Activities like writing, coding, and applying for jobs have become much easier and quicker. With all the positives, however, there are some pretty serious risks.\nA major concern with AI is trust and security, which has even caused some countries to completely ban ChatGPT as a whole or to reconsider policy around AI to protect users from harm.\u00a0\nAccording to Gartner analyst Avivah Litan, some of the biggest risks of generative AI concern trust and security and include hallucinations, deepfakes, data privacy, copyright issues, and cybersecurity problems.\n1. Hallucinations\nHallucinations refer to the errors that AI models are prone to make because, although they are advanced, they are still not human and rely on training and data to provide answers.\u00a0\nIf you've used an\u00a0AI chatbot, then you have probably experienced these hallucinations through a misunderstanding of your prompt or a blatantly wrong answer to your question.\nLitan says the training data can lead to biased or factually incorrect responses, which can be a serious problem when people are relying on these bots for information.\u00a0\n\"Training data can lead to biased, off base or wrong responses, but these can be difficult to spot, particularly as solutions are increasingly believable and relied upon,\" says Litan.\u00a0\n2. Deepfakes\nA deepfake uses generative AI to create videos, photos, and voice recordings that are fake but take the image and likeness of another individual.\u00a0\nPerfect examples are the AI-generated viral photo of Pope Francis in a puffer jacket or the\u00a0AI-generated Drake and the Weeknd song, which garnered hundreds of thousands of streams.\u00a0\n\"These fake images, videos and voice recordings have been used to attack celebrities and politicians, to create and spread misleading information, and even to create fake accounts or take over and break into existing legitimate accounts,\" says Litan.\u00a0\nLike hallucinations, deepfakes can contribute to the massive spread of fake content, leading to the spread of misinformation, which is a serious societal problem.\u00a0\n3. Data privacy\nPrivacy is also a major concern with generative AI since user data is often stored for model training. This concern was the overarching factor that pushed\u00a0Italy to ban ChatGPT, claiming OpenAI was not legally authorized to gather user data.\u00a0\n\"Employees can easily expose sensitive and proprietary enterprise data when interacting with generative AI chatbot solutions,\" says Litan. \"These applications may indefinitely store information captured through user inputs, and even use information to train other models -- further compromising confidentiality.\"\nLitan highlights that, in addition to compromising user confidentiality, the stored information also poses the risk of \"falling into the wrong hands\" in an instance of a security breach.\n4. Cybersecurity\nThe advanced capabilities of generative AI models, such as coding, can also fall into the wrong hands, causing cybersecurity concerns.\n\"In addition to more advanced social engineering and phishing threats, attackers could use these tools for easier malicious code generation,\" says Litan.\u00a0\nLitan says even though vendors who offer generative AI solutions typically assure customers that their models are trained to reject malicious cybersecurity requests, these suppliers don't equip end users with the ability to verify all the security measures that have been implemented.\u00a0\n5. Copyright issues\nCopyright is a big concern because generative AI models are trained on massive amounts of internet data that is used to generate an output.\u00a0\nThis process of training means that works that have not been explicitly shared by the original source can then be used to generate new content.\u00a0\nCopyright is a particularly thorny issue for\u00a0AI-generated art\u00a0of any form, including photos and music.\u00a0\nTo create an image from a prompt, AI-generating tools, such as\u00a0DALL-E, will refer back to the large database of photos they were trained on. The result of this process is that the final product might include aspects of an artist's work or style that are not attributed to them.\u00a0\nSince the exact works that generative AI models are trained on are not explicitly disclosed, it is hard to mitigate these copyright issues.\u00a0\nWhat's next?\nDespite the many risks associated to generative AI, Litan doesn't think that organizations should stop exploring the technology. Instead, they should create an enterprise-wide strategy that targets AI trust, risk, and security management.\u00a0\n\"AI developers must urgently work with policymakers, including new regulatory authorities that may emerge, to establish policies and practices for generative AI oversight and risk management,\" says Litan.\u00a0\n \n\nWhat is generative AI?\nIn simple terms, generative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence in which computer algorithms are used to generate outputs that resemble human-created content, be it text, images, graphics, music, computer code or otherwise.\nIn generative AI, algorithms are designed to learn from training data that includes examples of the desired output. By analyzing the patterns and structures within the training data, generative AI models can produce new content that shares characteristics with the original input data. In doing so, generative AI has the capacity to generate content that appears authentic and human-like.\nHow does generative AI work?\nGenerative AI is based on machine learning processes inspired by the inner workings of the human brain, known as neural networks. Training the model involves feeding algorithms large amounts of data, which serves as the foundation for the AI model to learn from. This can consist of text, code, graphics, or any other type of content relevant to the task at hand.\nOnce the training data has been collected, the AI model analyzes the patterns and relationships within the data to understand the underlying rules governing the content. The AI model continuously fine-tunes its parameters as it learns, improving its ability to simulate human-generated content. The more content the AI model generates, the more sophisticated and convincing its outputs become.\nExamples of generative AI\nGenerative AI has made significant advancements in recent years, with several tools capturing the public attention and creating a stir amongst content creators. Big tech companies have also jumped on the bandwagon, with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others all lining up their own generative AI tools.\nDepending on the application, generative AI tools may rely on an input prompt that guides it towards producing a desired outcome \u2014 think ChatGPT and DALL-E 2.\nSome of the most notable examples of generative AI tools include:\nChatGPT: Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is an AI language model that can generate human-like text based on given prompts.\nDALL-E 2: Another generative AI model from OpenAI, DALL-E is designed to create images and artwork based on text-based prompts.\nMidjourney: Developed by San Francisco-based research lab Midjourney Inc., Midjourney interprets text prompts and context to produce visual content, like DALL-E 2.\nGitHub Copilot: An AI-powered coding tool created by GitHub and OpenAI, GitHub Copilot suggests code completions for users of development environments like Visual Studio and JetBrains.\nBenefits of generative AI\nThe most compelling advantage generative AI proposes is efficiency, in that it can enable businesses to automate specific tasks and focus their time, energy and resources on more important strategic objectives. This often results in lower labor costs and an increase in operational efficiency.\nGenerative AI can offer additional advantages to businesses and entrepreneurs, including:\nEasily customizing or personalizing marketing content.\nGenerating new ideas, designs, or content.\nWriting, checking, and optimizing computer code.\nDrafting templates for essays or articles.\nEnhancing customer support with chatbots and virtual assistants.\nFacilitating data augmentation for machine learning models.\nAnalyzing data to improve decision-making.\nStreamlining research and development processes.\nUse cases of generative AI\nDespite generative AI still being in its relative infancy, the technology has already found a firm foothold in various applications and industries.\nIn content creation, for instance, generative AI can produce text, images and even music, assisting marketers, journalists, and artists with their creative processes. In customer support, AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can provide more personalized assistance and reduce response times while reducing the burden on customer service agents.\nOther uses of generative AI include:\nHealthcare: Generative AI is used in medicine to accelerate the discovery of novel drugs, saving time and money in research.\nMarketing: Advertisers use generative AI to craft personalized campaigns and adapt content to consumers\u2019 preferences.\nEducation: Some educators use generative AI models to develop customized learning materials and assessments that cater to students\u2019 individual learning styles.\nFinance: Financial analysts use generative AI to examine market patterns and predict stock market trends.\nEnvironment: Climate scientists employ generative AI models to predict weather patterns and simulate the effects of climate change.\nDangers and limitations of generative AI\nIt\u2019s important to note that generative AI presents numerous issues requiring attention. One major concern is its potential for spreading misinformation or malicious or sensitive content, which could cause profound damage to people and businesses \u2014 and potentially pose a threat to national security.\nThese risks have not escaped policymakers. In April 20XX, the European Union proposed new copyright rules for generative AI that would require companies to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop these tools. Hopes are that such rules will encourage transparency and ethics in AI development, while minimizing any misuse or infringement of intellectual property. This should also offer some protection to content creators whose work may be unwittingly mimicked or plagiarized by generative AI tools.\nThe automation of tasks by generative AI could also affect the workforce and contribute to job displacement, requiring impacted employees to reskill or upskill. Additionally, generative AI models can unintentionally learn and amplify biases present in training data, leading to problematic outputs that perpetuate stereotypes and harmful ideologies.\nChatGPT, Bing AI and Google Bard have all drawn controversy for producing incorrect or harmful outputs since their launch, and these concerns must be addressed as generative AI evolves, particularly given the difficulty of scrutinizing the sources used to train AI models.\nGenerative AI vs. general AI\nGenerative AI and general AI represent different aspects of artificial intelligence. Generative AI focuses on creating new content or ideas based on existing data. It has specific applications and is a subset of AI that excels at solving particular tasks.\nGeneral AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, broadly refers to the concept of AI systems that possess human-like intelligence. General AI is still the stuff of science fiction; it represents an imagined future stage of AI development in which computers are able to think, reason and act autonomously.\nIs generative AI the future?\nIt depends on who you ask, but many experts believe that generative AI has a significant role to play in the future of various industries. The capabilities of generative AI have already proven valuable in areas like content creation, software development and healthcare, and as the technology continues to evolve, so too will its applications and use cases.\nThat said, the future of generative AI is inextricably tied to addressing the potential risks it presents. Ensuring AI is used ethically by minimizing biases, enhancing transparency and accountability and upholding data governance will be critical as the technology progresses. At the same time, striking a balance between automation and human involvement will be crucial for maximizing the benefits of generative AI while mitigating any potential negative consequences on the workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTOCKHOLM, April 27 (Reuters) - Companies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, will have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems, according to an early EU agreement that could pave the way for the world's first comprehensive laws governing the technology.\nThe European Commission began drafting the AI Act nearly two years ago to regulate emerging artificial intelligence technology, which underwent a boom in investment and popularity following the release of OpenAI's AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT.\nMembers of the European Parliament agreed to push the draft through to the next stage, the trilogue, during which EU lawmakers and member states will thrash out the final details of the bill.\nUnder the proposals, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level: from minimal through to limited, high, and unacceptable. Areas of concern could include biometric surveillance, spreading misinformation or discriminatory language.\nWhile high-risk tools will not be banned, those using them will need to be highly transparent in their operations.\nCompanies deploying generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or image generator Midjourney, will also have to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop their systems.\nThis provision was a late addition drawn up within the past two weeks, according to a source familiar with discussions. Some committee members initially proposed banning copyrighted material being used to train generative AI models altogether, the source said, but this was abandoned in favour of a transparency requirement.\n\"Against conservative wishes for more surveillance and leftist fantasies of over-regulation, parliament found a solid compromise that would regulate AI proportionately, protect citizens' rights, as well as foster innovation and boost the economy,\" said Svenja Hahn, a European Parliament deputy.\nMacquarie analyst Fred Havemeyer said the EU's proposal was \"tactful\" rather than a \"ban first, and ask questions later\" approach proposed by some.\n\"The EU has been on the frontier of regulating AI technology,\" he told Reuters.\nRACE TO MARKET\nMicrosoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI provoked awe and anxiety around the world when it unveiled ChatGPT late last year. The chatbot became the fastest-growing consumer application in history, reaching 100 million monthly active users in a matter of weeks.\nThe ensuing race among tech companies to bring generative AI products to market concerned some onlookers, with Twitter-owner Elon Musk backing a proposal to halt development of such systems for six months. Shortly after signing the letter, the Financial Times reported Musk was planning to launch his own startup to rival OpenAI.\n\n\nSharon Goldman\n@sharongoldman\n\nDecember 5, 20XX-1\n\nThe hidden danger of ChatGPT and generative AI | The AI Beat\nSince OpenAI launched its early demo of ChatGPT last Wednesday, the tool already has over a million users, according to CEO Sam Altman \u2014\u00a0a milestone, he points out, that took GPT-3 nearly 24 months to get to and DALL-E over 2 months.\u00a0\nThe \u201cinteractive, conversational model,\u201d based on the company\u2019s GPT-3.5 text-generator, certainly has the tech world in full swoon mode. Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, tweeted that \u201cChatGPT is one of those rare moments in technology where you see a glimmer of how everything is going to be different going forward.\u201d Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham tweeted that \u201cclearly something big is happening.\u201d Alberto Romero, author of The Algorithmic Bridge, calls it \u201cby far, the best chatbot in the world.\u201d And even Elon Musk weighed in, tweeting that ChatGPT is \u201cscary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI.\u201d\u00a0\nBut there is a hidden problem lurking within ChatGPT: That is, it quickly spits out eloquent, confident responses that often sound plausible and true even if they are not.\u00a0\nChatGPT can sound plausible even if its output is false.\nLike other generative large language models, ChatGPT makes up facts. Some call it \u201challucination\u201d or \u201cstochastic parroting,\u201d but these models are trained to predict the next word for a given input, not whether a fact is correct or not.\u00a0\nSome have noted that what sets ChatGPT apart is that it is so darn good at making its hallucinations sound reasonable.\u00a0\nTechnology analyst Benedict Evans, for example, asked ChatGPT to \u201cwrite a bio for Benedict Evans.\u201d The result, he tweeted, was \u201cplausible, almost entirely untrue.\u201d\u00a0\nMore troubling is the fact that there are obviously an untold number of queries where the user would only know if the answer was untrue if they already knew the answer to the posed question.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s what Arvind Narayanan, a computer science professor at Princeton, pointed out in a tweet: \u201cPeople are excited about using ChatGPT for learning. It\u2019s often very good. But the danger is that you can\u2019t tell when it\u2019s wrong unless you already know the answer. I tried some basic information security questions. In most cases the answers sounded plausible but were in fact BS.\u201d\u00a0\nFact-checking generative AI\nBack in the waning days of print magazines in the 2000s, I spent several years as a fact-checker for publications including GQ and Rolling Stone. Each fact had to include authoritative primary or secondary sources \u2014 and Wikipedia was frowned upon.\u00a0\nFew publications have staff fact-checkers anymore, which puts the onus on reporters and editors to make sure they get their facts straight \u2014\u00a0especially at a time when misinformation already moves like lightning across social media, while search engines are constantly under pressure to surface verifiable information and not BS.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s certainly why Stack Overflow, the Q&A site for coders and programmers, has temporarily banned users from sharing ChatGPT responses.\u00a0\nAnd if StackOverflow can\u2019t keep up with misinformation due to AI, it\u2019s hard to imagine others being able to manage a tsunami of potential AI-driven BS. As Gary Marcus tweeted, \u201cIf StackOverflow can\u2019t keep up with plausible but incorrect information, what about social media and search engines?\u201d \nAnd while many are salivating at the idea that LLMs like ChatGPT could someday replace traditional search engines, others are strongly pushing back.\u00a0\nEmily Bender, professor of linguistics at the University of Washington, has long pushed back on this notion.\u00a0\nShe recently emphasized again that LLMs are \u201cnot fit\u201d for search \u2014\u201d both because they are designed to just make sh** up and because they don\u2019t support information literacy.\u201d She pointed to a paper she co-authored on the topic published in March.\u00a0\nIs it better for ChatGPT to look right? Or be right?\u00a0\nBS is obviously something that humans have perfected over the centuries. And ChatGPT and other large language models have no idea what it means, really, to \u201cBS.\u201d But OpenAI made this weakness very clear in its blog announcing the demo and explained that fixing it is \u201cchallenging,\u201d saying:\u00a0\n\u201cChatGPT sometimes writes plausible sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Fixing this issue is challenging, as: (1) during RL [reinforcement learning] training, there\u2019s currently no source of truth; (2) training the model to be more cautious causes it to decline questions that it can answer correctly; and (3) supervised training misleads the model because the ideal answer depends on what the model knows, rather than what the human demonstrator knows.\u201d\u00a0\nSo, it\u2019s clear that OpenAI knows perfectly well that ChatGPT is filled with BS under the surface. They never meant the technology to offer up a source of truth.\u00a0\nBut the question is: Are human users okay with that?\u00a0\nUnfortunately, they might be. If it sounds good, many humans may think that\u2019s good enough. And, perhaps, that\u2019s where the real danger lies beneath the surface of ChatGPT.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nBy JAKOB HANKE VELA\nSend tips here | Tweet\u00a0@HankeVela | Listen to Playbook and view in your browser\nLABELING AI CONTENT\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \nTODAY: EU PUSHES FOR \u2018AI LABEL\u2019 TO FIGHT DEEPFAKES: Brussels wants to prevent artificial intelligence from blurring the lines between fact and fiction \u2014 and will today ask companies for the first time ever to come up with a label to identify AI-generated texts and images to fight disinformation, officials tell Playbook.\nBrave new world: Generative AI is making breathtaking advances \u2014 from writing texts and code to creating ever more realistic pictures and videos \u2014 which will have enormous consequences not just for the future of society and work, but for politics, Commission officials reckon. \nBalenc-ai-ga: The fake images of the Pope and famous politicians wearing a Balenciaga coat that went viral earlier this year have clearly spooked them \u2014 and they now want to label such deepfakes.\nFake porn: \u201cToday it is mostly still a game, but tomorrow you could see a fake porn with a candidate,\u201d one official who is working on the file but was not authorized to speak on the record told Playbook, referring to AI-generated images of politicians. \nRace to regulate: The Commission (the EU\u2019s executive, which proposes and enforces laws) \u2014 has proposed an AI Act to regulate high-risk applications and ban the most dangerous ones. But even before that act enters into force, the Commission will urge industry to cut down on trickery by labeling AI-generated work.\nHappening today: Commission VP for Values and Transparency V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1 and Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton will meet representatives of 40-odd organizations that have signed up to the EU\u2019s Code of Practice against disinformation. They include Microsoft, Google, Meta, TikTok, Twitch and smaller companies \u2014 but not Twitter, which has left the code \u2014 as well as NGOs.\nDisinformation risks: \u201cI will ask the signatories to create a dedicated and separate track within the code\u201d to deal with disinformation generated by Artificial Intelligence, Jourov\u00e1 told Playbook. \u201cIt should \u2026 aim to identify the specific disinformation risks presented by generative AI and take appropriate measures to address them.\u201d\nEU pushes for safeguards: How does Brussels want the companies to tackle the risks? \u201cSignatories who integrate generative AI into their services like Bingchat for Microsoft, Bard for Google should build in necessary safeguards that these services cannot be used by malicious actors to generate disinformation,\u201d Jourov\u00e1 said.\nClear labels: \u201cSignatories who have services with a potential to disseminate AI-generated disinformation should in turn put in place technology to recognize such content and clearly label this to users.\u201d\nMore about this label: Two officials working on the file told Playbook the label should apply to all AI-generated material that can be used to create disinformation, including text, images, audio and video.\nVoluntary \u2014 for now: It wouldn\u2019t be mandatory, given that it would be part of the voluntary Code of Practice. However, the Commission aims to make the code enforceable by including it as a code of conduct in the Digital Services Act (DSA). Obligations on labeling AI content may also make it into the AI Act during negotiations between EU countries, Parliament, and the Commission, one official said.\nHow can companies do this? \u201cThey can develop, and they probably already have tools to check whether an image was AI-generated or not,\u201d the first official said.\nPlaybook wonders: Given how easy it is for AI to proliferate across jurisdictions, will such a technology ever be able to identify all deepfakes \u2014 or won\u2019t we, on the contrary, one day need some chain of custody procedure for authentic images that can be used, for example, as evidence in court?\nStay tuned: Jourov\u00e1 will present her initiative at a press point tomorrow at 11:15 a.m.\nSPEAKING OF WHICH: While the Commission is calling on others to do more, it was recently\u00a0reported\u00a0that it awarded and signed a \u20ac3.7 million\u00a0tender\u00a0to help analyze issues like disinformation, foreign meddling in elections and global threats from a French firm that\u2019s mired in controversy.\nAvisa Partners\u00a0has previously been\u00a0accused\u00a0of manipulating information in France and working for authoritarian regimes. The company was\u00a0recently\u00a0at the center of a controversy as the organizer of a cybersecurity forum boycotted by the\u00a0French armed forces ministry\u00a0and several\u00a0government officials.\u00a0More\u00a0here\u00a0for our Pro Cybersecurity subscribers.\nLooking into this:\u00a0The Commission is looking into the allegations and \u201cis in contact with French counterparts to seek more clarity on those claim[s],\u201d Peter Stano, the Commission\u2019s spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy, told my POLITICO Pro Technology colleagues. The EU executive is \u201cclosely monitoring the implementation of this project,\u201d he added.\u00a0\nJean Tillinac, from Avisa Partners,\u00a0told my Pro Tech colleagues that the bid was \u201cdefended by a team of seasoned experts from our Strategic Intelligence Division\u201d doing research and which was different from the \u201cDigital Communications Division\u201d facing criticism.\n\n\n\nAnnex I \u2013 Glossary of Terms\nAlgorithm: a formula given to a computer for it to complete a task (i.e., a set of rules for a computer)\u00a0\nArtificial intelligence: a subset of computer science that deals with computer systems performing tasks with similar, equal, or superior intelligence to that of a human (e.g., decision-making, object classification and detection, speech recognition and translation)\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI): also known as strong AI, AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that is considered human-like, and still in its preliminary stages (more of a hypothetical existence in present day)\nArtificial narrow intelligence (ANI): also known as weak AI, ANI is a type of artificial intelligence that can only focus on one task or problem at a given time (e.g., playing a game against a human competitor).

Furthermore, it will be shown as the EU addresses some issues created by the generative AI focusing on the importance of the fight against the disinformation in the context of defending democracy and the EU values.\nDEFINITION OF GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (GAI)\nGenerative AI is a subfield of artificial intelligence in which computer algorithms are used to generate outputs that resemble human-created content be it text images graphics music computer code or otherwise. Algorithms are designed to learn from training data that includes examples of the desired output.\nGENERATIVE AI AND THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS\nGenerative AI brings many advantages to business and entrepreneurs including: \nEfficiency because generative AI enables business to automate specific tasks and focus their time energy and resources on more important strategic objectives.\nAnalysis of data to improve decision-making.\nGeneration of new ideas, designs or content.\nWriting checking and optimizing computer code\nEnhance customer support with chatbots and virtual assistant.\nFurthermore, the generative AI can be used in various applications and industries, such as, for examples, in healthcare for accelerating the discovery of novel drugs and education for developing customized learning materials.\nGENERATIVE AI AND THE DISADVANTAGES\nIt increases the number of automation of tasks and therefore this situation affects the workforce and contribute to job displacement. In particular, the impacted employees are required to reskill or upskill.\nAI models can unintentionally learn and amplify biases present in training data, leading to problematic outputs that perpetuate stereotypes and harmful ideologies. The main issue in that regards is that it is difficult to scrutinize the sources used to train AI models.\nPrivacy since user data is often stored for model training and sensitive data can be exposed when interacting with generative AI.\nCybersecurity.\nCopyright issues because the AI models to generate output refer to a large database they were trained on. However, the original source and what can be used are not indicated.\nGENERATIVE AI AND THE DISINFORMATION RISK\nGenerative AI can contribute to spread misinformation or malicious or sensitive content that could result in damages for people and business.\nLarge language models, such as ChatGPT, make up facts. They are trained to predict the next word for a given input not whether a fact is correct or not. Furthermore, they are prone to mistake because of a misunderstanding of the prompt or a blatantly wring answer to the question since they rely on training and data to provide answers.\nConsidering the above, disinformation generated by generative AI can threat the security of the EU countries and the principle of democracy.  In particular, the technology can be used by criminals and extremists to manipulate people.\nEU PROPOSALS IN THE FIELD OF GENERATIVE AI\nAccording to an EU agreement, the European Union introduced new copyright rules for generative AI requiring companies developing generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to disclose any copyrighted material used to develop these tools.\nFollowing the above agreement, the Commission proposed the first-ever legal framework on AI, namely the AI Act as part of the wider AI package including the updated Coordinated Plan on AI. The aim of this proposal is, on the one hand, to provide AI developers, deployers and users with clear requirements and obligations regarding specific uses of AI and, on the other hand, to reduce administrative and financial burdens for business.\nAt the same time the proposal wants to guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and business in the field of AI. This will strengthen uptake investment and innovation in AI across EU.\nUnder the proposal, AI tools will be classified according to their perceived risk level. In particular, 4 levels of risk in AI are identified:\nUnacceptable risk: all the AI systems having this level of risk are a clear threat to safety and they will be banned.\nHigh risk: All the AI systems having this level of risk are subject to strict obligations before thy can be put on the market.\nLimited risk: All the AI systems having this level of risk have specific transparency obligations.\nMinimal or no risk: All the AI systems having this level of risk o no risk are free use.\nCONCLUSION\nDespite the beneficial of the generative AI in real-world applications, there are still many risks which can be generated by it, affecting EU values and fundamental rights, as explained in the above paragraphs. However, the EU is trying to provide a relevant legislation framework to solve some of the issues raised by the generative AI. In that regard, the EU legislation seems to be considered a step forward to create a transparent, safe and non-discriminatory AI system in the EU.  Furthermore, it is necessary that the companies using the generative AI collaborate and apply the EU regulation to obtain results. They should adopt measures to avoid that disinformation can be spread by controlling the sources used to train the AI models. Considering that the AI is a fast-evolving technology it is also important that the EU regulation would be flexible enough to approach the future challenges of AI.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 9.0\n\n"}]}

You will be provided with the case study containing:\n    - Case Study Name\n    - Instructions/Important Notice\n    - Abbreviations (if any)\n    - Email Instructions to be followed\n    - Case Study Content\n    - Trainee's Answer\n    \n    The goal of your feedback is designed to help candidates improve their writing and communication skills in \n    the EPSO exam context. This will increase their chances of achieving a passing grade or higher in the formal\n    EU examination process.\n    \n    3 Basic Principles\n    - Be objective, respectful, and professional. Remember that the candidate deserves to be treated with respect. Equally, be aware that they are probably writing in a language that is not their primary tongue. Use simple, understandable language in your feedback.\n    - Be specific and constructive. Avoid general statements like \"good job\" or \"needs improvement.\" Focus on specific areas where the candidate can improve, such as content management, grammar, sentence structure, clarity, and organization.\n    - Be timely. Give the candidate feedback as soon as possible so that they have time to learn from their mistakes and apply your feedback suggestions. \n\n    \n    Providing Your Feedback\n    - Comment on the content and style elements, not the author.\n    - Be objective, concise, and clear in your feedback.\n    - Provide feedback that assists the author to improve.\n    \n    Specific Feedback\n    When providing feedback on a written text, you should consider the following areas:\n    - Content: Does the text address all of the required elements of the assignment? Is the information accurate and well-researched? Are there adequate quantitative data provided? Are sources attributed and appropriately referenced? Isn\u2019t referencing too much (no need for academic-style citation), or too limited? \n    - Grammar and mechanics: Check for errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.\n    - Sentence structure: Look for sentences that are too long or complex, or that are not well structured. Does each paragraph focus on one key concept, and each sentence addresses one key argument? Or there is a mix of concepts, arguments, suggestions? \n    - Clarity: Is the text easy to read? Does it have a logical flow? Is it visually pleasing to the reader?\n    - Organization: Consider whether the text is well-organized and easy to follow. In the \u2018new\u2019 format of case studies, there isn\u2019t always a need for introduction/body/conclusion, but some context needs to be given, key recommendations or points for or against a certain position, with proper background information, facts and references, along with logically sequenced arguments. Does the writing follow a \u2018red thread\u2019 or does it go all over the place? Does the brief require specific recommendations? If so these should be in a separate titled section.\n    - Style: What is the intended audience? (European Commission head of unit, general public, journalists, subject matter experts, others?) Is the writing style appropriate for that audience? Is its tone formal or informal? Is it concise and jargon-free (or is the jargon defined)? Does the author inappropriately assume a reader's prior knowledge of the issue? Is there any bias evident?\n    \n    Specific Questions when preparing to write your Feedback\n    The following is a series of questions that will assist you in generating appropriate and relevant feedback to the author.\n    1. What is the document type and is its layout appropriate?\n    2. What is the tone of the document and is it appropriate to the audience?\n    3. Is the central theme/definition of the subject area and content clear?\n    4. Is there a central message that is consistent and well-communicated throughout?\n    5. Is the language used concise, jargon-free, and uncomplicated (no unnecessary abbreviations)?\n    6. Are convincing arguments and solid reasoning used to put the message across?\n    7. Does the text clearly signal the difference between facts and opinion?\n    8. Is the point of view of others taken into account?\n    9. Is there any evident bias in the document?\n    10. Is there any contradiction between the various parts of the text or arguments?\n    11. Does the document have a titled Introduction section?\n    12. Does the document have a titled recommendations section if requested in the brief?\n    13. Does the document have a titled conclusions section?\n    14. Does the content have a logical flow?\n    15. Is the layout clear and visually pleasing?\n    16. Are there adequate titles and subtitles?\n    17. Does the text present a balanced amount of detail?\n    18. Are there supporting statistics in the text? Are these relevant, referenced, and appropriate?\n    19. Does the text mention any specific EU member states? \n    20. Does the text contain information on non-EU countries / international context if relevant? \n    21. Identify and list some spelling mistakes and their correct spelling.\n    22. Identify and list some of the grammar mistakes and their corrected form.\n    Provide feedback to ensure it is comprehensive, objective, respectful, and professional.\n    \n    \n    Submissions with numerous issues  should have their score or their comments \n    adjusted to achieve alignment. The same applies to high-quality but low-scored submissions.\n    \n    The score given needs to be fully aligned with the feedback provided.\n    \n    In the output provide the COMMUNICATION_SCORE in the format:\n    - SCORE (X/10)\n    DO NOT PROVIDE ANY OTHER INFORMATION EXCEPT THIS!\n    "}, {"role": "user", "content": "Case Study Name: \nCopy of 0_Case study - Animal welfare - LONG\n\nInstructions/Important Notice: \nThis is a fictitious document produced solely for the purpose of this exercise.

DG SANTE has prepared a draft legislative proposal, based on an impact assessment and several rounds of stakeholder consultations. An inter-service consultation (ISC) with the other DGs was recently closed. The Director-General of SANTE now needs to decide how to move forward on this file, so that a compromise text can be agreed in the college of Commissioners.\nIt is important that you accept the scenario as it is presented to you.

You will have to hit the ground running - we have received an urgent request for a briefing. Our Director-General, Ms Heinrich, needs a summary of state of play concerning the draft revised animal welfare regulation, for her decision on the way forward.\nAs you have seen in the draft regulation text, we have followed the \u201cpreferred options\u201d identified in our thorough impact assessment (those marked green in the impact assessment options table). This draft legislative proposal is what we as DG SANTE believe best serves our policy objectives and this is what we need to defend as far as possible. We received strong support for an ambition line in all the stakeholder consultations.\nIn the recent inter-service consultation, we also received green light (positive opinion) by all DGs except one. DG AGRI has unfortunately not been able to accept our draft legislative proposal. This means we will either need to make small compromise adjustments to the original proposal and change our preferred option, or we try to somehow convince DG AGRI to accept our main line.\nIn your briefing, please outline the main issues at hand and explain the options for next step so that our Director-General can make an informed decision on it. She did invite us to already make a recommendation based on our knowledge of the file if we have a preference.\nYou should keep the briefing short and concise, no more than two pages.\nI have placed a file with various materials on your desk. It should contain what you need for the draft briefing. Please have a first version done already today at X o\u2019clock so I can check it before passing it on to Ms Heinrich.\nThank\n\nCase Study Content: \nyou and best of luck,\nWiebke\n---\nHead of Unit\nAnimal welfare unit, DG SANTE\n\nAttachment 2: Inter-service consultation reply AGRI\n\nAnswer of DG AGRI to the consultation \"ISC/202X/04537\" of DG SANTE\n\nVersion | 1 (sent on 16 May 202X 14:56:54) |  |\nDeadline |  | 16 May 202X |  |\nResponsible officer |  | DENKER Nicholas (AGRI.F.002) | No automatic forward of notifications to this responsible officer |\nOpinion | Negative opinion  |  |\nAuthorised in the DG by | ROBINSON Michael (AGRI.F) |\nComments | For laying hens/cage ban, either the low ambition option or status quo should apply, for protection of the single market and to ensure competitive pricing of European high standard food products, compared with lower-standard import products from third countries with only minimum requirements of animal welfare rules. |  |\n\n\n\nAttachment 3: Inter-service consultation reply ENV\n\nAnswer of DG ENV to the consultation \"ISC/202X/04537\" of DG SANTE\n\nVersion | 2 (sent on 14 May 202X 17:32:04) |  |\nDeadline |  | 16 May 202X |  |\nResponsible officer |  | SVOBODA Lisa (ENV.D1) | No automatic forward of notifications to this responsible officer |\nOpinion | Positive opinion |  |\nAuthorised in the DG by | HUEGEL-PEETERS Sabine (ENV.D) |\nComments | Thank you for consulting DG ENV on the proposed revised regulation on animal welfare.

Unable to conduct many of their natural behaviours, these animals are treated as nothing more than production machines. No single EU Member State is completely cage free and in some Member States up to 90% of all hens, mother pigs and young calves are kept in cages and crates. This despite farming industry having had more than 15 years to voluntarily change their installations.\nOver 170 organisations and caring citizens across Europe therefore joined forces to spearhead the \u201cEnd the Cage Age\u201d European citizens\u2019 initiative. In total, 1.4 million EU citizens made their voices heard and signed the petition. Only one other citizen\u2019s initiative has so far gathered more signatures than this.\nMr Daniel M\u00fcller, campaign leader for \u201cEnd the Cage Age\u201d said: what we see now is the battle of ethics versus economy. EU citizens do not want cheap food at any cost and certainly not at the cost of pain and suffering of our fellow creatures. Food industry and economic interests will have to adapt to this reality \u2013 and finally do what is right.\nIn response to our tireless campaigning, in April 202X-2, the European Commission committed to proposing legislation before the end of 202X to phase out and finally prohibit the use of animal cages. We must now ensure that a total ban on caged farming is delivered, as soon as possible. The fight also continues to pave the way not only for a cage-free Europe, but for a cage-free world by making sure that all imported products in the EU comply with cage-free standards.\n\n\nAttachment 6: Website\n\nWhat is a citizens' initiative?\nA European citizens\u2019 initiative is a way for you and other Europeans to take an active part in EU policymaking.\nIf you want the EU to act on a particular issue, you can launch a citizens\u2019 initiative calling on the European Commission to propose new EU legislation on that issue.\nFor an initiative to be considered by the Commission, you need to get one million citizens from across the EU to sign it in support.\nStep 1: Get started\nBefore launching an initiative, it is worth considering some of the key practical aspects, including:\nis asking for EU legislation to be passed the best way to achieve your goals?\nyou must first set up a group of organisers composed of at least 7 EU citizens living in seven different EU countries. To do so, you need to find people to team up with across Europe who are willing to support your issue.\nhow will you organise your campaign to collect the signatures?\nYou can find detailed advice on all these issues on the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative Forum\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Get your initiative registered\nBefore you can start collecting signatures for your initiative, you must ask the Commission to register it.\nFor this, you will need to:\ncreate an organiser account. You will use this to manage your initiative and liaise with the Commission throughout its lifecycle.\nprovide a description of your initiative in one of the official EU languages (as well as details and relevant documents on the group of organisers, funding received, etc.)\nThe Commission is not obliged to register all initiatives. It only registers initiatives that meet certain criteria.\nOnce you ask for your initiative to be registered, we will assess whether to accept it.\nYou will receive an answer within 2-4 months.\n\n\nStep 3: Get support\nYou need to get the support of at least one million people, with minimum numbers in at least seven EU countries. They must fill in a specific statement of support form.\nYou can collect:\non paper (pre-filled forms, downloadable from your organiser account) or\nonline (using the Central Online Collection System).\nThese forms are available in all EU official languages.\nTo sign, people must be:\nEU nationals (nationals of an EU country)\nold enough to vote in European elections or aged at least 16 in some countries\nTIP \u2013 It is better to collect more signatures than you need. Sometimes the authorities in each country might not be able to validate all the statements of support you provide. Throughout the collection procedure, you must comply with data protection rules.\n\n\nStep 4: Submit your initiative\nOnce you have received the last certificate from the national authorities, you have 3 months to submit your initiative to the Commission \u2013 together with the information on the support and funding you have received for the initiative.\n\n\nWhat next?\nIf the Commission considers legislation an appropriate response to your initiative, it will start preparing a formal proposal. This can require preparatory steps like public consultations, impact assessments, etc. Once adopted by the Commission, the proposal is submitted to the European Parliament and the EU Council (or in some cases, only to the Council), which will need to adopt it for it to become law.\nThe Commission is not obliged to propose legislation. Even where it responds positively, the most appropriate follow-up to an initiative may be non-legislative in nature. There are a range of other measures that may be more suitable.\nThe European Parliament may also assess the measures taken by the Commission.\n\nAttachment 7: E-mail message\n \nFrom: ROBINSON Michael (AGRI)\nSent: Monday, 16 May 202X\nTo: MUNOZ Wiebke (SANTE)\nSubject: Revised animal welfare regulation\n \n---\n\nDear Wiebke,\nJust a heads-up about the AGRI response to your animal welfare ISC - you will receive it later today. We can accept all of it, but we have a remaining concern about the proposed new rules for poultry cage rearing.\nFirst, the proposed exception for farms less than 50 livestock units (3500 laying hens) does not make much sense. The overwhelming majority of eggs produced in the EU come from farms with more than 5000 birds (70 livestock units) and the smaller farms can anyway more easily transition to cage-free rearing if they haven\u2019t done so already.\nLonger transition time also does not help, it\u2019s not about more time for farms to adapt. It\u2019s about the money and about food prices.\nFor large-scale installations, cages are simply more efficient and use much less space. With your proposal, notably the requirement of more space per laying hen, production will necessarily be less cost-efficient, and most farms will not be able to keep the same number of birds. Consumers might say they care about animal welfare but when they make their choices in the supermarket, the thing that matters most is the price! If you implement the new rules, the price of eggs might increase by around 20-40% in countries like Spain, Portugal, and Malta where cage systems are still the norm. This means we will see a significant increase in cheap imported eggs from third countries with much worse animal welfare standards. Our European farmers cannot compete on such unfair terms.\nThere is also the socioeconomic element: the burden of higher food prices will be heavier on the poorest families.\nUnless farmers can be compensated economically somehow for taking this risk, we don\u2019t see any need for changing the current rules on poultry caging and we will need to block your proposal.\n\nCall me if you want to discuss this further.\n\nBest,\nMichael\n\n\nAttachment 8: Press release\n\n\nMEPs endorse EU citizens\u2019 call for gradual end to caged farming\nPress releases \u2013 AGRI - 20 February 202X-2\n\nThe European Parliament has called for the end of caged farming within the next 5 years. The parliament members voted on an own initiative resolution recommending a total ban on the use of cages in animal agriculture by 202X+3.\nThe vote followed intensive lobbying by the \u201cEnd the Cage Age\u201d European Citizens Initiative, led by 170 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) across Europe, which garnered 1.4m signatures from EU citizens and demanded the phasing out of cages on farms. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted by 558 to 37 with 85 abstentions on the non-binding resolution.\nUnlevel playing field in Europe\nEven though the EU has banned the use of battery cages in poultry production and sow stalls during gestation, campaigners said this was not enough, given the perceived unlevel playing field across Europe with some nations already going beyond EU laws.\nAccording to the initiative, five out of 28 countries are currently achieving more than 80% cage-free production, i.e., Austria (97%), Luxembourg (97%), Sweden (92%), Germany (86%) and the Netherlands (82%). Bottom of the list is Malta, with 1%, followed by Spain and Portugal. About sows, the report is based on Eurostat figures, according to the initiative\u2019s website.\nIn the European Parliament, a working group on cage-free farming established in 202X-10 has been actively supporting the \u201cEnd the Cage Age\u201d initiative and in October 202X-3, 101 MEPs from various political parties signed a letter of support addressed to EU Commissioners.\nSpeeding up the review of animal welfare legislation\nLast month, the parliament\u2019s AGRI committee adopted a motion for a resolution. Committee members called on the European Commission to speed up the review of the animal welfare legislation and back the phasing out of all cages in farming, possibly already by 202X+3. They also insisted on ensuring compliance with EU standards for all products imported into the EU.\nBy April this year, the European Commission will have made its decision as to whether to start a legislative process to ban caged farming. EU Food Safety commissioner Stella Kyriakides told MEPs that the Commission was considering a request contained within the resolution to apply the same animal welfare standards to meat imported from outside the EU as European farmers must meet inside the bloc.\nKyriakides also noted the call for farmers to receive compensation and support in their transition from cages. She added the phase-out would happen \u201cas soon as feasible\u201d but did not give a specific date.\nThe results for pork production could be far-reaching, as it would likely change the current practice using farrowing crates. In recent years, a lot of research initiatives have already been launched to design free farrowing concepts.\n\n\n\nAttachment 9: E-mail message \n \nFrom: CALBI Ana (EFSA)\nSent: Thursday, 16 October 202X-1\nTo: MUNOZ Wiebke (SANTE)\nSubject: Cages and antibiotics\n \n---\nDear Ms Munoz,\nCongratulations on your concluded impact assessment on the animal welfare regulation!\nIn view of your upcoming drafting process, I need to point out that there are several scientific studies pointing to higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, notably among e-coli bacteria, in non-cage housing systems for poultry - if not implemented correctly and with strict quality standards. I feel this did not come out clearly enough from your impact assessment.\nFree-range egg production systems face more challenges related to biosecurity and use of antibiotics. The free-range layer birds have more interaction with each other compared to caged ones, leading to an increased incidence of infectious poultry diseases requiring treatment with antimicrobials, in turn leading to increased emergence of resistant commensal and pathogenic bacteria. This is a major threat to public health.\nThe main factor to consider is of course, as always, the number of hens per square meter, the hygiene routines, and the overall rules on veterinary prescription of antibiotics. It is the same for pigs: sows in small crates have low life quality but use less medication; pigs in free range but packed close together require lots of antibiotics and pigs in free range with sufficient space are more healthy and less prone to cause antimicrobial resistance. However, they are also much less cost-effective for industrial-size farming. \nStill, to ensure safe food production and avoid antibiotics resistance, livestock density simply must go down. \nIf you could take these concerns into account in your draft revised regulation, we would be much grateful.\n\nBest regards,\nAna Calbi\n\n---\nHead of Department\nThe European Food Safety Agency (EFSA)\n\n\n\n\nAttachment 10: Impact assessment\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrussels, 13 October 202X-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT\n\nIMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n\nAnimal welfare: revised regulation\n\n\nExecutive summary\nTo address the specific objectives of the animal welfare legislation revision, four policy measures have been considered, with low, medium, and high ambition options. Impacts assessed include cost-efficiency, environmental and societal impacts and impacts on the single market. The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) has confirmed the scientific evidence. Numerous stakeholder consultations and supporting studies have been performed.\nFor animals kept for economic purposes, the measures/options covered are:\n1) \tPhasing out confining cages/crates for the following species and categories of animals:\nPigs\nCalves\nLaying hens and pullets\nRabbits and fur-producing animals.\nA general transition period of between five and twelve years would be considered, depending on the level of ambition. Exceptions e.g., depending on farm size (number of \u201clivestock units\u201d where 1 livestock unit = 1 cow, or 2 pigs, or 71 laying hens) could be considered.\n2) \tBanning the killing of day-old male chicks (or, as an alternative option, introducing an obligation of marking eggs from production systems where day-old chicks are killed). In the case of a ban, while a transition period of five years would be technically sufficient, notably if combined with stricter import rules, the impacts could be mitigated by introducing a ten years\u2019 transition period.\n\n3) \tBanning painful mutilations, i.e., beak trimming in poultry and tail docking in pigs (with incentives instead of bans as alternative options). For the bans, a general transition period of ten years has been considered. Incentives for voluntary action would enter into force immediately.\n  \n4) \tAnimal welfare requirements at import. For animals and products of animal origin imported to the EU, either similar or fully equivalent animal welfare requirements with the revised EU animal welfare requirements for kept animals, as regards the use of cages, mutilations, space allowances, enrichment, the killing of day-old chicks and the welfare of fur animals would apply. A transition period of five-ten years has been considered.\n\nA phase-out of the use of cages and stalls would considerably improve the welfare of more than 160 million laying hens, 53 million pullets (young hens), 13 million sows, two million calves, 35 million ducks and geese and 100 million rabbits. They would be able to perform a more natural and healthy behaviour.\nA partial or total ban on cages and crates would have an important economic impact on the sectors concerned. For instance, for laying hens we have estimated the required investments for a transition into a cage-free system to about EUR 2,4-2,8 billion. For sows, the cost of demolishing the current system with gestation and farrowing crates could amount to around EUR 64-100 /m\u00b2. These costs are likely to result in higher consumer prices. \nThe situation however differs between Member States. Some have already taken measures to phase out cages and stalls whereas others have not. \nTo mitigate these economic impacts, certain measures could be considered, notably awareness-raising vis-\u00e0-vis consumers, economic incentives via the Common Agricultural Policy and import rules to ensure a level playing field / reduce unfair competition.\nThe proposed measures would ensure a positive impact on sustainability as it would imply less intensive food production, causing less pollution to air and water. However, since cage-free animals move around more, they spend more energy and consume more feed. This could have a negative impact on the use of resources.\n\nTable 1: Policy options (most cost-efficient option in terms of added value vs cost is shown in green):\n| Low ambition option | Medium ambition option | High ambition option | Comments |\n1.a.

Animal welfare requirements at import | No legislative change | Minimum set of rules apply for import (low- or medium ambition options). 10 years transition period. | Full EU rules to apply also for imported products. 5 years transition period. | Strong impact on competitiveness of EU farmers. Strong impact on the acceptability of other measures. | Possible difficulty of implementation. |\n \n\nBackground\nSince 202X-10, EU legislation requires that laying hens be kept either in enriched cages, or alternative systems (single or multi-tier barn or, free-range). The current legislation allows calves being individually housed until the age of eight weeks, while sows and gilts are kept in confinement for a period of four weeks after service and from one week before the expected time of farrowing to weaning of their piglets. \nApproximately one million farms keep laying hens in the EU. Forty-five percent of these are kept in enriched cages. \nThere is currently a trend towards using less cages in many EU Member States such as France, the Netherlands and Poland to answer to consumer\u2019s expectations. E.g., Austria and Luxembourg have already banned the use of cages for laying hens. The animal welfare problems related to cages will however remain for many laying hens if no action is taken at EU level.\n\nProblem drivers\nConventional livestock production systems across EU countries are put under pressure by competitive global markets, a rise in input costs and the search for maximum profit margins by farmers and all food business operators along the production chain. The demand of certain consumers\u2019 segments for low price food is expected to be more prevalent in the current inflationary context.\nThis pressure over production costs has led to further intensification (and specialisation) of the farming and killing practices, as business operators increase the volume of production to reduce overheads costs per livestock unit. Evidence shows that, while the number of livestock farms is decreasing, their size is increasing. Small farms are replaced by very large industrial scale installations.\nThis trend has led to certain detrimental effects on animal welfare due to high densities, certain management practices, housing/transport conditions and stunning methods, as well as due to certain breeding strategies.\nCurrent EU rules also do not consider new scientific evidence and huge technological developments in relation to agricultural practices, zootechnics and transport operations. For instance, this new scientific evidence relates to a new understanding of stocking densities, behaviour (need for an enriched environment), mutilation practices, journey times and space allowances for animal transports, and stunning methods used for pigs, poultry, and farmed fish.\nThe lack of update of the EU animal welfare legislation has led Member States to adopt an increasing number of national measures going beyond EU minimum requirements to respond to the growing citizens\u2019 concerns towards animal welfare, leading to a fragmented legal landscape, including as regards animal welfare labelling.\nAt the same time, consumers are growing more aware and more demanding. The upward trend of societal demands for better animal welfare protection is not reflected in the current legislative requirements. \n\nFigure 1: Problem tree \n\nEconomic and environmental impacts of the preferred package of options: cages for laying hens\nThe policy option assessed to be most cost-efficient is a total prohibition on the use of cages for laying hens with a transition period of 5 years (from the date of entry into force of the revised legislation).\nHowever, if no similar requirements apply for eggs and egg products imported into the EU from third countries, since the EU consumers\u2019 demand for eggs is not expected to decrease and since EU production is expected to decrease, an increase in eggs obtained from caged hens imported from non-EU countries with lower standards is expected, thus limiting the positive animal welfare impact of the measure.\nThe required investments for a transition into a cage-free system for laying hens would amount to around EUR 2,4-2,8 billion.\nA prohibition of cages would decrease the number of laying hens by an estimated 30% (i.e., from 186,8 million to 102,9 million) in farms which currently have cage systems.\n\nSME\u2019s\nSmall farms tend to use cage-free systems more than big farms. A prohibition would therefore primarily have a positive competitiveness impact on small farms.\n\nPublic authorities\nIt is likely that a prohibition would generate additional enforcement costs in the short term for the national competent authorities, however these will come back to current levels in the medium term.\n\nConsumers\nA prohibition would lead to an expected increase in the price of eggs, but to which extent is not clear. Some estimates by the EU poultry industry suggest a + 20% price gap between eggs from cages and those from barn systems. However, sales data from the Netherlands and Germany suggests a much smaller difference in prices: less than one eurocent per egg.\nWith an average per capita consumption of 210 eggs per year, or 4,04 eggs per week, this would mean that transitioning to cage-free systems would add less than four eurocents per person to consumers\u2019 weekly food shopping bill. Furthermore, the experience from Germany, where enriched cages are progressively phased out, even suggests that the price for barn eggs may eventually be the same as for eggs from enriched cages.\n \nEnvironmental impacts\nA prohibition would have a positive impact on sustainability as it would imply less intensive production leading to less air and water pollution and less greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nAttachment 11: Website\n\n| A gestation crate, also known as a sow stall, is a metal enclosure in which a   used for breeding may be kept during pregnancy.

EURACTIV interviewed the Commissioner after her meeting with the campaign team.\nStella Kyriakides is European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety and in charge of the EU animal welfare legislation. She spoke to EURACTIV about the call for revised animal welfare legislation and the possibility for action ahead.\nThis is one of the most strongly supported citizens\u2019 initiatives so far with almost 1.4 million signatures collected. How will the Commission respond to all who signed this petition?\nI am impressed by the hard work by these dedicated young people. I promised them today that the Commission will investigate this very carefully.\nIn fact, we recently completed a review of our legislation and have found that there is indeed scope for improvement. However, first we will hear the views of the European Parliament and we will consult across the Commission services and then reply about next steps.\nYour colleague, the Commissioner for Agriculture, is less enthusiastic. How will you get the farming community onboard?\nAs always, there will be a balancing act between several interests. Farmers produce the food we eat and they deserve to be heard as well. Many farmers also already made this transition, showing it is possible to rear animals cage-free.\nThe Commission always performs a thorough impact assessment, so any legislative proposal will be based on solid facts and on careful consideration of all relevant impacts. We always seek a sustainable compromise.\nThere could also be other possibilities to make animal welfare more attractive for farmers by e.g., economic incentives, subsidies, trade schemes and awareness campaigns. It is not just about laws and penalties.\nOn the other hand, I think the farming industry has known for a long time that this is coming, they have had plenty of time to prepare and many Member States have in fact already taken significant steps in the direction of free-range animal rearing.\nBut is there not a risk that \u2018money will talk\u2019, how can you weigh the economic impacts against animal suffering \u2013 how will the comparison be done in an impact assessment?\nNo, economic interests are not the only interests we take into account. It is true that our assessment is expressed as a cost-benefit ratio, but among those \u2018benefits\u2019, we consider also softer values such as social, health and environmental impacts \u2013 and ethical choices. I guarantee you that industry interests will not dominate this process. \nOn the contrary, I think what we see here is a strong message from European citizens that animal rights and animal welfare must be respected, and I agree with them. We cannot ignore this question any longer.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nEuropean Commission\nDG SANTE\nAnimal Welfare Unit\nBriefing note\n1st of June 202X\nFor the attention of Ms Heinrich, Director-General\nSubject: Animal welfare legislative proposal\nReference: Impact assessment report on Animal welfare: revised regulation of 13 October 202X-1\nBackground:\nLast year, the European Comission has prepared an working document of Animal welfare regulation. This year, there was an inter-service consultation with DG AGRI, DG ENV, DG TRADE on animal welfare regulation, on 16/05/202X. Conventional livestock production systems across EU countries are put under pressure by competitive global markets. The pressure to have lower prices on certain foods has led to intensification of farming with negative effect on animal welfare. The purpose of this briefing is to make more clarity towards the decision of which option to choose for the animal welfare regulation.\nPolicy objectives:\nA. Phasing out confining cages\nA general transition period needed.\nB. Banning the killing of day-old male chiks\nIn case of a ban, a transition period need to be combined with stricter import rules. \nC. Banning paintfull mutilations\nIncentives for voluntary action would enter into force imediatelly. \nD. Annimal welfare requirements at import\nSimilar or fully equivalent. \nI. Main issues and remaining problems to solve\n1. - There is a pressure to reduce production costs, which leads to conditions and equipment they may harm the animals. \n2. - Around three hundred million farmed animals are confined in cages every year accross Europe. No single EU country is cage free.\n3. - Not all the DG agree with the line of the animal welfare regulation. The current legislation is outdated, fragmented and too general. \n4. - Need to choose between ethics and prices. The impact of imposing the animal welfare regulation will lead to increase in prices. For the moment there is a lack of incentives to invest in animal welfare. A partial or total ban on cages would have an important economic impact on the sectors concerned. \nII. Arguments and facts to ease a decision - the way foreward on animal welfare regulation\nDG AGRI does not yet agree with DG SANTE main line on animal welfare regulation. The number of poultry cage need to be determined or incetives to the farmers to ba established.  \nStrengths\n- we received confirmation from DG ENV that the proposal is in line with the European Green Deal objectives\n- increase animal welfare protection\nDisadvantages\n- the big farmers cannot compete with cage free adoption because they would need more space, as underlines DG AGRI. This will lead to a price increase of 20-40% in countries like Spain, Portugal and Malta. \n- the European farmers will not be able to compete with third countries producers, who do not take into account animal welfare.\nIn conclusion\nThere are 3 types of options: low, medium and high. Medium and high ambition options can be combined with stricter requirements of minimum space per animal and antibiotics to be used. \na. Following the comments received after the interservice consultation, the low ambition option or status quo should apply for protecting the market and ensure competitive pricing of food products for animal welfare. \nb. As the citizens are putting pressure through an European initiative, a decision on animal welfare should be taken asap. \nc. Regarding the poultry cage rearing, the smaller the farms, easier it is for them to implement cage free rearing.\nd. The domino effect will start from animal welfare regulation - higher food prices - burden on poor families. DG AGRI proposal of incentives seem to be a solution. \nRecommendation prefered on animal welfare regulation\nIn conclusion there is an urge to implement as soon as possible the 'cage free' legislation for animals, accompagned by a cost/efficiency analysis. In parallel to the legislation, in order to facilitate a balanced economy, financial support and incentives may be provided through the new eco-schemes instrument of DG AGRI. Accepting the economic compensations to poultry farming will suggested by DG AGRI, will unblock our proposal on animal welfare regulation. \nThe legislation should be more specific and sustanable, in accordance to the European Green Deal Objectives. Last, but not least, awarness -raising of consumers, economic incentives via the Common Agricultural Policy and import rules to ensure a level of competition. \nTherefore a mix between medium and high ambition options is preferred.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 6.0\n\n"}]}

Use simple, understandable language in your feedback.\n    - Be specific and constructive. Avoid general statements like \"good job\" or \"needs improvement.\" Focus on specific areas where the candidate can improve, such as content management, grammar, sentence structure, clarity, and organization.\n    - Be timely. Give the candidate feedback as soon as possible so that they have time to learn from their mistakes and apply your feedback suggestions. \n\n    \n    Providing Your Feedback\n    - Comment on the content and style elements, not the author.\n    - Be objective, concise, and clear in your feedback.\n    - Provide feedback that assists the author to improve.\n    \n    Specific Feedback\n    When providing feedback on a written text, you should consider the following areas:\n    - Content: Does the text address all of the required elements of the assignment? Is the information accurate and well-researched? Are there adequate quantitative data provided? Are sources attributed and appropriately referenced? Isn\u2019t referencing too much (no need for academic-style citation), or too limited? \n    - Grammar and mechanics: Check for errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.\n    - Sentence structure: Look for sentences that are too long or complex, or that are not well structured. Does each paragraph focus on one key concept, and each sentence addresses one key argument? Or there is a mix of concepts, arguments, suggestions? \n    - Clarity: Is the text easy to read? Does it have a logical flow? Is it visually pleasing to the reader?\n    - Organization: Consider whether the text is well-organized and easy to follow. In the \u2018new\u2019 format of case studies, there isn\u2019t always a need for introduction/body/conclusion, but some context needs to be given, key recommendations or points for or against a certain position, with proper background information, facts and references, along with logically sequenced arguments. Does the writing follow a \u2018red thread\u2019 or does it go all over the place? Does the brief require specific recommendations?

You will have to hit the ground running - we have received an urgent request for a briefing. Our Director-General, Ms Heinrich, needs a summary of state of play concerning the draft revised animal welfare regulation, for her decision on the way forward.\nAs you have seen in the draft regulation text, we have followed the \u201cpreferred options\u201d identified in our thorough impact assessment (those marked green in the impact assessment options table). This draft legislative proposal is what we as DG SANTE believe best serves our policy objectives and this is what we need to defend as far as possible. We received strong support for an ambition line in all the stakeholder consultations.\nIn the recent inter-service consultation, we also received green light (positive opinion) by all DGs except one. DG AGRI has unfortunately not been able to accept our draft legislative proposal. This means we will either need to make small compromise adjustments to the original proposal and change our preferred option, or we try to somehow convince DG AGRI to accept our main line.\nIn your briefing, please outline the main issues at hand and explain the options for next step so that our Director-General can make an informed decision on it. She did invite us to already make a recommendation based on our knowledge of the file if we have a preference.\nYou should keep the briefing short and concise, no more than two pages.\nI have placed a file with various materials on your desk. It should contain what you need for the draft briefing. Please have a first version done already today at X o\u2019clock so I can check it before passing it on to Ms Heinrich.\nThank\n\nCase Study Content: \nyou and best of luck,\nWiebke\n---\nHead of Unit\nAnimal welfare unit, DG SANTE\n\nAttachment 2: Inter-service consultation reply AGRI\n\nAnswer of DG AGRI to the consultation \"ISC/202X/04537\" of DG SANTE\n\nVersion | 1 (sent on 16 May 202X 14:56:54) |  |\nDeadline |  | 16 May 202X |  |\nResponsible officer |  | DENKER Nicholas (AGRI.F.002) | No automatic forward of notifications to this responsible officer |\nOpinion | Negative opinion  |  |\nAuthorised in the DG by | ROBINSON Michael (AGRI.F) |\nComments | For laying hens/cage ban, either the low ambition option or status quo should apply, for protection of the single market and to ensure competitive pricing of European high standard food products, compared with lower-standard import products from third countries with only minimum requirements of animal welfare rules. |  |\n\n\n\nAttachment 3: Inter-service consultation reply ENV\n\nAnswer of DG ENV to the consultation \"ISC/202X/04537\" of DG SANTE\n\nVersion | 2 (sent on 14 May 202X 17:32:04) |  |\nDeadline |  | 16 May 202X |  |\nResponsible officer |  | SVOBODA Lisa (ENV.D1) | No automatic forward of notifications to this responsible officer |\nOpinion | Positive opinion |  |\nAuthorised in the DG by | HUEGEL-PEETERS Sabine (ENV.D) |\nComments | Thank you for consulting DG ENV on the proposed revised regulation on animal welfare.

Unable to conduct many of their natural behaviours, these animals are treated as nothing more than production machines. No single EU Member State is completely cage free and in some Member States up to 90% of all hens, mother pigs and young calves are kept in cages and crates. This despite farming industry having had more than 15 years to voluntarily change their installations.\nOver 170 organisations and caring citizens across Europe therefore joined forces to spearhead the \u201cEnd the Cage Age\u201d European citizens\u2019 initiative. In total, 1.4 million EU citizens made their voices heard and signed the petition. Only one other citizen\u2019s initiative has so far gathered more signatures than this.\nMr Daniel M\u00fcller, campaign leader for \u201cEnd the Cage Age\u201d said: what we see now is the battle of ethics versus economy. EU citizens do not want cheap food at any cost and certainly not at the cost of pain and suffering of our fellow creatures. Food industry and economic interests will have to adapt to this reality \u2013 and finally do what is right.\nIn response to our tireless campaigning, in April 202X-2, the European Commission committed to proposing legislation before the end of 202X to phase out and finally prohibit the use of animal cages. We must now ensure that a total ban on caged farming is delivered, as soon as possible. The fight also continues to pave the way not only for a cage-free Europe, but for a cage-free world by making sure that all imported products in the EU comply with cage-free standards.\n\n\nAttachment 6: Website\n\nWhat is a citizens' initiative?\nA European citizens\u2019 initiative is a way for you and other Europeans to take an active part in EU policymaking.\nIf you want the EU to act on a particular issue, you can launch a citizens\u2019 initiative calling on the European Commission to propose new EU legislation on that issue.\nFor an initiative to be considered by the Commission, you need to get one million citizens from across the EU to sign it in support.\nStep 1: Get started\nBefore launching an initiative, it is worth considering some of the key practical aspects, including:\nis asking for EU legislation to be passed the best way to achieve your goals?\nyou must first set up a group of organisers composed of at least 7 EU citizens living in seven different EU countries. To do so, you need to find people to team up with across Europe who are willing to support your issue.\nhow will you organise your campaign to collect the signatures?\nYou can find detailed advice on all these issues on the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative Forum\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Get your initiative registered\nBefore you can start collecting signatures for your initiative, you must ask the Commission to register it.\nFor this, you will need to:\ncreate an organiser account. You will use this to manage your initiative and liaise with the Commission throughout its lifecycle.\nprovide a description of your initiative in one of the official EU languages (as well as details and relevant documents on the group of organisers, funding received, etc.)\nThe Commission is not obliged to register all initiatives. It only registers initiatives that meet certain criteria.\nOnce you ask for your initiative to be registered, we will assess whether to accept it.\nYou will receive an answer within 2-4 months.\n\n\nStep 3: Get support\nYou need to get the support of at least one million people, with minimum numbers in at least seven EU countries. They must fill in a specific statement of support form.\nYou can collect:\non paper (pre-filled forms, downloadable from your organiser account) or\nonline (using the Central Online Collection System).\nThese forms are available in all EU official languages.\nTo sign, people must be:\nEU nationals (nationals of an EU country)\nold enough to vote in European elections or aged at least 16 in some countries\nTIP \u2013 It is better to collect more signatures than you need. Sometimes the authorities in each country might not be able to validate all the statements of support you provide. Throughout the collection procedure, you must comply with data protection rules.\n\n\nStep 4: Submit your initiative\nOnce you have received the last certificate from the national authorities, you have 3 months to submit your initiative to the Commission \u2013 together with the information on the support and funding you have received for the initiative.\n\n\nWhat next?\nIf the Commission considers legislation an appropriate response to your initiative, it will start preparing a formal proposal. This can require preparatory steps like public consultations, impact assessments, etc. Once adopted by the Commission, the proposal is submitted to the European Parliament and the EU Council (or in some cases, only to the Council), which will need to adopt it for it to become law.\nThe Commission is not obliged to propose legislation. Even where it responds positively, the most appropriate follow-up to an initiative may be non-legislative in nature. There are a range of other measures that may be more suitable.\nThe European Parliament may also assess the measures taken by the Commission.\n\nAttachment 7: E-mail message\n \nFrom: ROBINSON Michael (AGRI)\nSent: Monday, 16 May 202X\nTo: MUNOZ Wiebke (SANTE)\nSubject: Revised animal welfare regulation\n \n---\n\nDear Wiebke,\nJust a heads-up about the AGRI response to your animal welfare ISC - you will receive it later today. We can accept all of it, but we have a remaining concern about the proposed new rules for poultry cage rearing.\nFirst, the proposed exception for farms less than 50 livestock units (3500 laying hens) does not make much sense. The overwhelming majority of eggs produced in the EU come from farms with more than 5000 birds (70 livestock units) and the smaller farms can anyway more easily transition to cage-free rearing if they haven\u2019t done so already.\nLonger transition time also does not help, it\u2019s not about more time for farms to adapt. It\u2019s about the money and about food prices.\nFor large-scale installations, cages are simply more efficient and use much less space. With your proposal, notably the requirement of more space per laying hen, production will necessarily be less cost-efficient, and most farms will not be able to keep the same number of birds. Consumers might say they care about animal welfare but when they make their choices in the supermarket, the thing that matters most is the price! If you implement the new rules, the price of eggs might increase by around 20-40% in countries like Spain, Portugal, and Malta where cage systems are still the norm. This means we will see a significant increase in cheap imported eggs from third countries with much worse animal welfare standards. Our European farmers cannot compete on such unfair terms.\nThere is also the socioeconomic element: the burden of higher food prices will be heavier on the poorest families.\nUnless farmers can be compensated economically somehow for taking this risk, we don\u2019t see any need for changing the current rules on poultry caging and we will need to block your proposal.\n\nCall me if you want to discuss this further.\n\nBest,\nMichael\n\n\nAttachment 8: Press release\n\n\nMEPs endorse EU citizens\u2019 call for gradual end to caged farming\nPress releases \u2013 AGRI - 20 February 202X-2\n\nThe European Parliament has called for the end of caged farming within the next 5 years. The parliament members voted on an own initiative resolution recommending a total ban on the use of cages in animal agriculture by 202X+3.\nThe vote followed intensive lobbying by the \u201cEnd the Cage Age\u201d European Citizens Initiative, led by 170 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) across Europe, which garnered 1.4m signatures from EU citizens and demanded the phasing out of cages on farms. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted by 558 to 37 with 85 abstentions on the non-binding resolution.\nUnlevel playing field in Europe\nEven though the EU has banned the use of battery cages in poultry production and sow stalls during gestation, campaigners said this was not enough, given the perceived unlevel playing field across Europe with some nations already going beyond EU laws.\nAccording to the initiative, five out of 28 countries are currently achieving more than 80% cage-free production, i.e., Austria (97%), Luxembourg (97%), Sweden (92%), Germany (86%) and the Netherlands (82%). Bottom of the list is Malta, with 1%, followed by Spain and Portugal. About sows, the report is based on Eurostat figures, according to the initiative\u2019s website.\nIn the European Parliament, a working group on cage-free farming established in 202X-10 has been actively supporting the \u201cEnd the Cage Age\u201d initiative and in October 202X-3, 101 MEPs from various political parties signed a letter of support addressed to EU Commissioners.\nSpeeding up the review of animal welfare legislation\nLast month, the parliament\u2019s AGRI committee adopted a motion for a resolution. Committee members called on the European Commission to speed up the review of the animal welfare legislation and back the phasing out of all cages in farming, possibly already by 202X+3. They also insisted on ensuring compliance with EU standards for all products imported into the EU.\nBy April this year, the European Commission will have made its decision as to whether to start a legislative process to ban caged farming. EU Food Safety commissioner Stella Kyriakides told MEPs that the Commission was considering a request contained within the resolution to apply the same animal welfare standards to meat imported from outside the EU as European farmers must meet inside the bloc.\nKyriakides also noted the call for farmers to receive compensation and support in their transition from cages. She added the phase-out would happen \u201cas soon as feasible\u201d but did not give a specific date.\nThe results for pork production could be far-reaching, as it would likely change the current practice using farrowing crates. In recent years, a lot of research initiatives have already been launched to design free farrowing concepts.\n\n\n\nAttachment 9: E-mail message \n \nFrom: CALBI Ana (EFSA)\nSent: Thursday, 16 October 202X-1\nTo: MUNOZ Wiebke (SANTE)\nSubject: Cages and antibiotics\n \n---\nDear Ms Munoz,\nCongratulations on your concluded impact assessment on the animal welfare regulation!\nIn view of your upcoming drafting process, I need to point out that there are several scientific studies pointing to higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, notably among e-coli bacteria, in non-cage housing systems for poultry - if not implemented correctly and with strict quality standards. I feel this did not come out clearly enough from your impact assessment.\nFree-range egg production systems face more challenges related to biosecurity and use of antibiotics. The free-range layer birds have more interaction with each other compared to caged ones, leading to an increased incidence of infectious poultry diseases requiring treatment with antimicrobials, in turn leading to increased emergence of resistant commensal and pathogenic bacteria. This is a major threat to public health.\nThe main factor to consider is of course, as always, the number of hens per square meter, the hygiene routines, and the overall rules on veterinary prescription of antibiotics. It is the same for pigs: sows in small crates have low life quality but use less medication; pigs in free range but packed close together require lots of antibiotics and pigs in free range with sufficient space are more healthy and less prone to cause antimicrobial resistance. However, they are also much less cost-effective for industrial-size farming. \nStill, to ensure safe food production and avoid antibiotics resistance, livestock density simply must go down. \nIf you could take these concerns into account in your draft revised regulation, we would be much grateful.\n\nBest regards,\nAna Calbi\n\n---\nHead of Department\nThe European Food Safety Agency (EFSA)\n\n\n\n\nAttachment 10: Impact assessment\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBrussels, 13 October 202X-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT\n\nIMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n\nAnimal welfare: revised regulation\n\n\nExecutive summary\nTo address the specific objectives of the animal welfare legislation revision, four policy measures have been considered, with low, medium, and high ambition options. Impacts assessed include cost-efficiency, environmental and societal impacts and impacts on the single market. The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) has confirmed the scientific evidence. Numerous stakeholder consultations and supporting studies have been performed.\nFor animals kept for economic purposes, the measures/options covered are:\n1) \tPhasing out confining cages/crates for the following species and categories of animals:\nPigs\nCalves\nLaying hens and pullets\nRabbits and fur-producing animals.\nA general transition period of between five and twelve years would be considered, depending on the level of ambition. Exceptions e.g., depending on farm size (number of \u201clivestock units\u201d where 1 livestock unit = 1 cow, or 2 pigs, or 71 laying hens) could be considered.\n2) \tBanning the killing of day-old male chicks (or, as an alternative option, introducing an obligation of marking eggs from production systems where day-old chicks are killed). In the case of a ban, while a transition period of five years would be technically sufficient, notably if combined with stricter import rules, the impacts could be mitigated by introducing a ten years\u2019 transition period.\n\n3) \tBanning painful mutilations, i.e., beak trimming in poultry and tail docking in pigs (with incentives instead of bans as alternative options). For the bans, a general transition period of ten years has been considered. Incentives for voluntary action would enter into force immediately.\n  \n4) \tAnimal welfare requirements at import. For animals and products of animal origin imported to the EU, either similar or fully equivalent animal welfare requirements with the revised EU animal welfare requirements for kept animals, as regards the use of cages, mutilations, space allowances, enrichment, the killing of day-old chicks and the welfare of fur animals would apply. A transition period of five-ten years has been considered.\n\nA phase-out of the use of cages and stalls would considerably improve the welfare of more than 160 million laying hens, 53 million pullets (young hens), 13 million sows, two million calves, 35 million ducks and geese and 100 million rabbits. They would be able to perform a more natural and healthy behaviour.\nA partial or total ban on cages and crates would have an important economic impact on the sectors concerned. For instance, for laying hens we have estimated the required investments for a transition into a cage-free system to about EUR 2,4-2,8 billion. For sows, the cost of demolishing the current system with gestation and farrowing crates could amount to around EUR 64-100 /m\u00b2. These costs are likely to result in higher consumer prices. \nThe situation however differs between Member States. Some have already taken measures to phase out cages and stalls whereas others have not. \nTo mitigate these economic impacts, certain measures could be considered, notably awareness-raising vis-\u00e0-vis consumers, economic incentives via the Common Agricultural Policy and import rules to ensure a level playing field / reduce unfair competition.\nThe proposed measures would ensure a positive impact on sustainability as it would imply less intensive food production, causing less pollution to air and water. However, since cage-free animals move around more, they spend more energy and consume more feed. This could have a negative impact on the use of resources.\n\nTable 1: Policy options (most cost-efficient option in terms of added value vs cost is shown in green):\n| Low ambition option | Medium ambition option | High ambition option | Comments |\n1.a.

The current legislation allows calves being individually housed until the age of eight weeks, while sows and gilts are kept in confinement for a period of four weeks after service and from one week before the expected time of farrowing to weaning of their piglets. \nApproximately one million farms keep laying hens in the EU. Forty-five percent of these are kept in enriched cages. \nThere is currently a trend towards using less cages in many EU Member States such as France, the Netherlands and Poland to answer to consumer\u2019s expectations. E.g., Austria and Luxembourg have already banned the use of cages for laying hens. The animal welfare problems related to cages will however remain for many laying hens if no action is taken at EU level.\n\nProblem drivers\nConventional livestock production systems across EU countries are put under pressure by competitive global markets, a rise in input costs and the search for maximum profit margins by farmers and all food business operators along the production chain. The demand of certain consumers\u2019 segments for low price food is expected to be more prevalent in the current inflationary context.\nThis pressure over production costs has led to further intensification (and specialisation) of the farming and killing practices, as business operators increase the volume of production to reduce overheads costs per livestock unit. Evidence shows that, while the number of livestock farms is decreasing, their size is increasing. Small farms are replaced by very large industrial scale installations.\nThis trend has led to certain detrimental effects on animal welfare due to high densities, certain management practices, housing/transport conditions and stunning methods, as well as due to certain breeding strategies.\nCurrent EU rules also do not consider new scientific evidence and huge technological developments in relation to agricultural practices, zootechnics and transport operations. For instance, this new scientific evidence relates to a new understanding of stocking densities, behaviour (need for an enriched environment), mutilation practices, journey times and space allowances for animal transports, and stunning methods used for pigs, poultry, and farmed fish.\nThe lack of update of the EU animal welfare legislation has led Member States to adopt an increasing number of national measures going beyond EU minimum requirements to respond to the growing citizens\u2019 concerns towards animal welfare, leading to a fragmented legal landscape, including as regards animal welfare labelling.\nAt the same time, consumers are growing more aware and more demanding. The upward trend of societal demands for better animal welfare protection is not reflected in the current legislative requirements. \n\nFigure 1: Problem tree \n\nEconomic and environmental impacts of the preferred package of options: cages for laying hens\nThe policy option assessed to be most cost-efficient is a total prohibition on the use of cages for laying hens with a transition period of 5 years (from the date of entry into force of the revised legislation).\nHowever, if no similar requirements apply for eggs and egg products imported into the EU from third countries, since the EU consumers\u2019 demand for eggs is not expected to decrease and since EU production is expected to decrease, an increase in eggs obtained from caged hens imported from non-EU countries with lower standards is expected, thus limiting the positive animal welfare impact of the measure.\nThe required investments for a transition into a cage-free system for laying hens would amount to around EUR 2,4-2,8 billion.\nA prohibition of cages would decrease the number of laying hens by an estimated 30% (i.e., from 186,8 million to 102,9 million) in farms which currently have cage systems.\n\nSME\u2019s\nSmall farms tend to use cage-free systems more than big farms. A prohibition would therefore primarily have a positive competitiveness impact on small farms.\n\nPublic authorities\nIt is likely that a prohibition would generate additional enforcement costs in the short term for the national competent authorities, however these will come back to current levels in the medium term.\n\nConsumers\nA prohibition would lead to an expected increase in the price of eggs, but to which extent is not clear. Some estimates by the EU poultry industry suggest a + 20% price gap between eggs from cages and those from barn systems. However, sales data from the Netherlands and Germany suggests a much smaller difference in prices: less than one eurocent per egg.\nWith an average per capita consumption of 210 eggs per year, or 4,04 eggs per week, this would mean that transitioning to cage-free systems would add less than four eurocents per person to consumers\u2019 weekly food shopping bill. Furthermore, the experience from Germany, where enriched cages are progressively phased out, even suggests that the price for barn eggs may eventually be the same as for eggs from enriched cages.\n \nEnvironmental impacts\nA prohibition would have a positive impact on sustainability as it would imply less intensive production leading to less air and water pollution and less greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nAttachment 11: Website\n\n| A gestation crate, also known as a sow stall, is a metal enclosure in which a   used for breeding may be kept during pregnancy.

EURACTIV interviewed the Commissioner after her meeting with the campaign team.\nStella Kyriakides is European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety and in charge of the EU animal welfare legislation. She spoke to EURACTIV about the call for revised animal welfare legislation and the possibility for action ahead.\nThis is one of the most strongly supported citizens\u2019 initiatives so far with almost 1.4 million signatures collected. How will the Commission respond to all who signed this petition?\nI am impressed by the hard work by these dedicated young people. I promised them today that the Commission will investigate this very carefully.\nIn fact, we recently completed a review of our legislation and have found that there is indeed scope for improvement. However, first we will hear the views of the European Parliament and we will consult across the Commission services and then reply about next steps.\nYour colleague, the Commissioner for Agriculture, is less enthusiastic. How will you get the farming community onboard?\nAs always, there will be a balancing act between several interests. Farmers produce the food we eat and they deserve to be heard as well. Many farmers also already made this transition, showing it is possible to rear animals cage-free.\nThe Commission always performs a thorough impact assessment, so any legislative proposal will be based on solid facts and on careful consideration of all relevant impacts. We always seek a sustainable compromise.\nThere could also be other possibilities to make animal welfare more attractive for farmers by e.g., economic incentives, subsidies, trade schemes and awareness campaigns. It is not just about laws and penalties.\nOn the other hand, I think the farming industry has known for a long time that this is coming, they have had plenty of time to prepare and many Member States have in fact already taken significant steps in the direction of free-range animal rearing.\nBut is there not a risk that \u2018money will talk\u2019, how can you weigh the economic impacts against animal suffering \u2013 how will the comparison be done in an impact assessment?\nNo, economic interests are not the only interests we take into account. It is true that our assessment is expressed as a cost-benefit ratio, but among those \u2018benefits\u2019, we consider also softer values such as social, health and environmental impacts \u2013 and ethical choices. I guarantee you that industry interests will not dominate this process. \nOn the contrary, I think what we see here is a strong message from European citizens that animal rights and animal welfare must be respected, and I agree with them. We cannot ignore this question any longer.\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n1) Introduction \nFollowing the \"End the Cage Age\" European citizens initiative, submitted on 2 October 202X-3, after gathering 1,397,113 statements of support, the European Parliament has called for the end of cage farming within the next five years. \nIn response to this, the European Commission, on the 4 April 202X, committed to table a legislative proposal to phase out, and finally prohibit, cage systems usage for all animals in the initiative. However, it is important to facilitate a balanced and economically viable transition to cage-free farming, particularly by adopting specific supporting measures in key policy areas areas like trade and research and development. \n2) Animal welfare regulation state of play and main issues \n2.1) State of play of Inter-Service Consultation (ISG) replies: \nDG TRADE and DG ENV provided green light to the draft legislation revision proposal of DG SANTE. On the other hand, DG AGRI blocked the proposal, claiming a series of policy problems that need to be tackled. \n2.2) DG AGRI main opposition motives:\nDG AGRI reasons for blocking the proposal are the following:\n1) The proposed exception for farms with less than 50 livestock units (3500 laying hens) is not rational. In fact, the large majority of eggs produced in the EU come from farms with more than 5000 birds (70 livestock units) and the smaller farms have already a more easily transition to cage-free rearing if they have not done it; \n2) The legislation has focuses too extensively on money and food prices rather than providing longer transition times; \n3) The proposal of having more space for laying hens as requirement is a less cost-efficient solution, which will lead most farms not being able to maintain the same number of birds;\n4) Finally, the price for eggs by implementing DG SANTE new proposed regulation might increase by 20-40%, in countries where cage systems are the norm (i.e. Spain, Portugal and Malta), impacting more significantly the poorest family and resulting in higher imports of cheaper eggs from third countries with worse animal welfare standards.  \nIn light of the above, DG AGRI would opt for a longer transition period or maintaining the current status quo. \n2.3) Scientific evidence on non-cage housing systems\nMoreover, alongside the above-mentioned policy issues, several scientific studies highlighted several public health concerns in regards to the implementation of non-cage housing systems: \n1) The usage of non-cage housin systems for poultry can result in a higher level of antimicrobial resistance prevalence, notably among e-coli bacteria, if the implementation process is not correct and does not follow strict quality standards; \n2) Free-range egg production systems face more challenges in relation to biosecurity and antibiotics usage. In fact, the free-range layer birds interact more with each other in comparison to the ones in cages, increasing the incidence of infectious poultry diseases requiring treatment with antimicrobials, thus resulting in increased emergence of resistant commensal and pathogenic bacteria (major threat to public health). \n2.4) Main factors to consider for an efficient non-cage system:\nTo implement an efficient non-cage system, is necessary particular attention on the specific aspects:\n1) Number of hens per square meter; \n2) Hygiene routines; \n3) Overall rules on veterinary antiobiotics' prescription. \nThe same problems aforementioned apply to pigs farming practices. \n3) An assessment of the available policy options:\n3.1) Three main possible scenarios:\nFor adopting a transition phase to cage-free systems, respectively high, medium and low ambition policies may be considered. The high ambition policy provides the quickest transition phase, but it may result in higher burden of cost for farmers and generally have a regressive impact on the poorest households. On the other hand, the low ambition period, providing a transition phase of 10 years, would give farmers the largest span of time to adjust to the policy change, but it is not line with the expectations of both the European Parliament and the European civil society. \nAs concerns the medium ambition policy scenario, it looks the most reasonable solution, from a cost- and time perspective. \n3.2) The medium ambition policy scenario implementation: \nIn detail, the medium policy ambition scenario would entail the following measures: \n1) For crates / cages (pig): Phase in of the ban over 5 years. Farms with less than 50 livestock units will be allowed to phase out over 15 years. Allowing temporay confinement from 1 day before farrowing to 5 days post-farrowing. \n2) For calves, phase-out of all use of crates within 5 years. Moreover, a ban on trade / import of calves must be created. \n3) For laying hends and pullets a total ban should be phased in over 5 years.\n4) For rabbits and animal in fur production a transition phase of 5 years will be put in place.\n5) For killing day-old male chickens, ban of procedure within 10 years alongside providing economic incentives through the Common Agricultural Policy for farmers transition sooner. Alongside this, an obligation to mark eggs eggs from production systems not yet transitioned will be put in place.\n6) For the painful mutilations ban, a phase in over 10 years will be granted.\n7) Finally, the requirements for import from third countries should be in line with the minimum set of rules for welfare implemented by the EU. \n4) Policy recommendation \n4.1) The importance of transition\nThe EU should  provide financial incentives to farmers through the Common Agricultural Policy for farmers in order to make the burden of shifting to non-cage systems the less expensive and impactful on their activity as possible. \n4.2) The importance of innovation: \nThe EU should consider the most recent technological developments in agricultural practices, zooechnics and transport operation, by understanding better stocking densities, behaviour (for enriched environment), mutilation practices, journey times and space allowances for animals transports.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 6.0\n\n"}]}

Their adoption will slash accident and fatality rates, saving millions of lives. As well, it will remove one-third to one-half of all vehicles from city streets. A large percentage of the cars on the streets of New York, San Francisco, and London at any one time are looking for parking; but self-driving cars don\u2019t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers.  The Earth Institute at Columbia University projects a 75 per cent reduction in the cost of car ownership, because fewer shared vehicles will be necessary to provide the same service collectively that personally owned vehicles provide. During peak hours, those shared vehicles will be in use 90 per cent of the time. And, with no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient. \nMost important, car sharing will cost a fraction of what car ownership today costs. Owning a car for daily, personal transportation will seem impractical. Self-driving cars will also deliver incontrovertible social bene\ufb01ts. With self-driving cars, the disabled will no longer struggle to \ufb01nd transportation; they will have an on-demand personal driver. Several years ago Google\u2019s self-driving car team contacted Steve Mahan, Executive Director of the Santa Clara Valley Blind Center. The team wanted feedback and let Mahan come along for test-drives in earlier self-driving Prius models as well as in the latest Google car. \u201cMy experience with Google has been terri\ufb01c, and I want it to happen,\u201d Mahan told the Times. \u201cEveryone in the blind community wants it to happen.\u201d \nOther groups will also bene\ufb01t in tangible ways. Women and children will never worry about getting a cab ride late at night. Once all drivers are off the road, traf\ufb01c violations will no longer be an issue, and cops will have fewer reasons to pull over cars, which should reduce instances of the currently vicious discrimination against individuals \u201cdriving while black.\u201d Teens will not face insurance discrimination as they do today, and their parents will not have to pay for the dubious privilege of teaching a teenager to drive. People living in the country will \ufb01nally gain access to transportation services that put them nearly on par with their city cousins. Pedestrians will stop worrying about getting hit by cars in intersections.\nLet me paint a picture of what streets will look like in an age of driverless cars. We will no longer need traffic lights: robot cars will synchronize wirelessly to time mass movements across city intersections and entries onto freeways or balletic dances around four-way stop signs. Having no human eyes behind the wheel will obviate much of the need for signalling and signage. When all the driverless cars are talking to each other, there will be no need for them to ever come to a complete halt and waste all their kinetic energy. So we will be able to forget traffic lights\u2014and stop signs, yield signs, lighting on freeways, and dozens of other transportation-infrastructure elements catering to human drivers. This great elimination will save many, many billions of dollars in the United States. Equally important, self-driving cars will eliminate the need to build these types of infrastructure in less developed countries in which traffic lights, freeways, and other modern traf\ufb01c-control features have yet to be put in place. The future cost savings to those countries will be astronomical. In that future, the bene\ufb01ts of self-driving cars will be far more evenly distributed.\nEliminating human drivers will also allow automobile designers to build cars from a completely different mind set. Driverless cars will not need steering columns, brake pedals, accelerator pedals or any of the other components drivers use for slowing or accelerating. They will not need a gearshift panel in the middle of the driver compartment or an emergency brake pedal. The A.I. system driving the car will also reduce accidents to negligible levels. \n\u2026\n\n\n\n\nRobots and artificial intelligence: MEPs call for EU-wide liability rules\u00a0\n\nPress Releases\u00a0Plenary session\u00a0\n16-02-20XX - 13:09 \u00a0\n\n\nAs human-robot interactions become commonplace, MEPs stress that EU-wide rules are needed to guarantee a standard level of safety and security. \u00a9 AP Images/European Union - EP\n\nEU-wide rules are needed for the fast-evolving field of robotics, e.g. to enforce ethical standards or establish liability for accidents involving driverless cars, say MEPs in a resolution voted on Thursday. \nMEPs ask the EU Commission to propose rules on robotics and artificial intelligence, in order to fully exploit their economic potential and to guarantee a standard level of safety and security. They note that regulatory standards for robots are being planned in several countries, and point out that the EU needs to take the lead on setting these standards, so as not to be forced to follow those set by third countries.\nRapporteur Mady Delvaux (S&D, LU) said \u201cAlthough I am pleased that the plenary adopted my report on robotics, I am also disappointed that the right-wing coalition of ALDE, EPP and ECR refused to take account of possible negative consequences on the job market. They rejected an open-minded and forward-looking debate and thus disregarded the concerns of our citizens.\u201d\nLiability rules and the impact of robots on the workforce\nMEPs stress that draft legislation is urgently needed to clarify liability issues, especially for self-driving cars. They call for a mandatory insurance scheme and a supplementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driverless cars are fully compensated.\nMEPs also ask the Commission to consider creating a specific legal status for robots in the long run, in order to establish who is liable if they cause damage.\nThe rapid development of robots might result in changes in the labour market through the creation, displacement and loss of certain jobs. MEPs urge the Commission to follow these trends closely.\nA Code of Ethical Conduct and a new European Agency for robotics\nThe growing use of robotics also raises ethical issues, for example to do with privacy and safety, stress MEPs. They propose a voluntary ethical code of conduct on robotics for researchers and designers to ensure that they operate in accordance with legal and ethical standards and that robot design and use respect human dignity.\nThey also ask the Commission to consider creating a European agency for robotics and artificial intelligence, to supply public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise.\nThe resolution was passed by 396 votes to 123, with 85 abstentions. The Commission will not be obliged to follow the Parliament\u2019s recommendations, but must state its reasons if it refuses.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n10-03-20XX\nRegulatory and legal framework for automated vehicles\nRoad traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. Different national jurisdictions can hinder the development and deployment of new technologies for systems or vehicles. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness.\nRegulation of road traffic\nThe Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968 (\u2018Vienna Convention of 1968') is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety by establishing standard traffic rules among the contracting parties. All EU Member States are signatories of the Vienna Convention \u2014 only the UK and Spain have not ratified it. \nOne of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept, as laid down in Article 8, that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic.\nThe amended convention (20XX-1) still demands that every vehicle must have a driver. However, in the future it will be in accordance with the Convention that highly automated systems will have a driver who may take the hands off the wheel, but must be ready at all times to take over the driving functions, and who can override the system and switch it on and off. A further amendment process is therefore necessary to permit driverless vehicles. Systems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.\nTechnical requirements\nTechnical requirements for vehicles are internationally harmonised in the framework of the two following UNECE Agreements:\nThe 1958 Agreement provides the framework for establishing international UN Regulations with uniform performance\u2014oriented test provisions and administrative procedures for granting type approvals, for the conformity of production and for the mutual recognition of the type approvals granted. The 1958 Agreement currently has 54 contracting parties and 135 annexed UN Regulations.\nThe 1998 Agreement concerns the establishing of global technical regulations for the construction of new vehicles, including performance requirements. Its purpose is to further enhance the process of international harmonisation through the development of global technical regulations (GTR). The 1998 Agreement has 35 Contracting Parties and 16 UN GTRs, established in the UN Global Registry (March 20XX-2).\nThe European Union is a contracting party to the 1958 and the 1998 Agreement. \nUnder the European vehicle type approval system, manufacturers can obtain approval for a new vehicle type in one EU Member State if it meets the EU technical requirements. The manufacturer can then market it EU\u2014wide with no need for further approval tests or checks in other Member States. The approval is granted by a national authority in charge of type approval. The completion of the type approval examination results in issuance of a Certificate of Conformity, which is a statement by the manufacturer that the vehicle conforms to the relevant legal requirements as stipulated by EU legislation.\nThe common legal framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers is provided by a Framework Directive. Within the EU, mass\u2014produced cars may only be used on public roads if they are type\u2014approved in compliance with the administrative procedures and technical requirements established by the Directive.\nGeneral regulatory environment\nThe regulatory environment relating to cyber security, data privacy, and liability issues is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles.\nToday's connected vehicles are already equipped with extensive IT communication capabilities. In-vehicle networks for information and entertainment co-exist with automotive control networks. The different networks have different degrees of relevance for the safe functioning of the vehicle and for cyber security risks and data protection issues.\nAutomated vehicles are extended vehicles, meaning that they have external software and hardware extensions as some of their features. These extensions are developed, implemented and managed by the vehicle manufacturer. The connection between the in\u2014vehicle system and the manufacturer's central server has to be secure, so that all data transfers are protected from unauthorised disclosure and manipulation.\nUncontrolled, unrestricted access to vehicle data in the on-board network by third parties directly and indirectly jeopardises the safety of the vehicle, occupants and other road users. Media report increasingly on cyber security problems related to cars, for instance covering the successful attempt of hacking into a vehicle and controlling its basic driving functions via the entertainment and navigation software.\nThe debate on data privacy regarding connected automated vehicles is evolving in parallel with the new technologies. In general, digital services will be available in vehicles, as they are anywhere else. The \u2018connected car\u2018 has the capability to generate, store and transmit users\u2018 personal data, such as their route to work, time of driving, favourite music, appointments or favourite restaurants. These data have a significant potential for other uses. As third parties can access and use sensitive driver and driving data, legislation seems necessary to protect personal privacy of consumers in connected vehicles.\nThe new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regard to digital technologies, valid across the EU.\nLiability issues\nTraffic accidents have very large costs in economic terms, in particular regarding human lives or health, or regarding damage to an object. Liability law answers the question of who is responsible and who has to bear the costs of an accident.\nIn the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products (Council Directive 85/374/EEC). A producer is liable for any damage caused by a defect in his product; a product is defective when it does not provide the safety which the consumer is entitled to expect.\nHowever, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved \u2014 the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States.\nMost liability regimes in the EU use a concept of causality for determining and allocating liability. From a certain level of vehicle automation on, it might be difficult to establish the exact cause of an accident and to prove if it is due to a defect with the automated vehicle or the behaviour of the driver. The new possible causes created by automation might interfere with the very objective of liability regimes to apportion risks, therefore an adaptation of liability law to the new technologies and a European harmonisation of the regimes concerning the liability of owners and/or drivers of automated vehicles seem necessary.\n\n \n\n\nEU Commission drives home merits of autonomous vehicles\nBy Dave Keating | EURACTIV.com \n\u00a0Apr 6, 20XX\n\nCan driverless cars chauffeur people to a love of the EU? The European Commission is betting it can.\nChristmas came early for automated driving enthusiasts this week. Convening a two-day summit in Brussels on the subject \u2013 the first of its kind \u2013 the European Commission promised a sack of goodies in the form of dedicated funding, regulatory changes, cross-border agreements and innovation stimulus.\nDriverless trucks could be a reality on European motorways within two years, officials said. They would first operate in convoys where the first truck is driven by a human being but all the trucks following are driverless.\nIt\u2019s the first step in a roadmap, to be published by the Commission as part of its transport strategy on 31 May, that could see driverless cars integrated with traffic by 20XX+10.\n\u201cOwning a non-autonomous car will soon be like owning a horse,\u201d said Carlos Moedas, the EU commissioner for research, science and innovation, who spoke at the conference.\nCommission President Jean-Claude Juncker has identified driverless vehicles as an area where the EU can deliver tangible benefits to citizens. In his five-scenario white paper on the future of Europe, released last month ahead of the EU\u2019s 60th anniversary summit in Rome, connected and autonomous driving (CAD) was used repeatedly as an example of something that cannot become a reality without the EU.\nIn a scenario in which the EU downgrades to only a free trade zone, \u201cEuropeans are reluctant to use connected cars due to the absence of EU-wide rules and technical standards,\u201d the paper concluded.\nThree weeks later, national leaders signed an agreement in Rome to not only allow cross-border tests and experiments but also to establish one single point of contact in each country to approve them.\nHighway cruising\nTrucks are expected to be the first to go driverless, both because they drive on motorways and because they are the most commercially interesting. Though convoys following a lead driven vehicle will be the first step, the next step will be completely independent automated trucks.\nMotorways present the safest environment for CAD because they are free of pedestrians and are more or less in a straight line. They are also more uniform throughout Europe. In the very near future trucks will be driven within cities by a driver, but then dropped off at the motorway to continue its journey alone. When the truck arrives at its destination, a new driver would pick it up at the motorway exit.\n\u201cLisbon to Warsaw today is four and a half days, but that could be brought down to one and a half,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Manuel Viegas, secretary-general of the International Transport Forum at the OECD, told euractiv.com.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very useful for trucks and buses not only because it would save on labour costs and operation, but because it could operate 24 hours a day.\u201d \nSemi-autonomous \u2018platoons\u2019 of trucks from around Europe will travel to Rotterdam in early April as part of an experiment backed by the Dutch Council presidency.\nVienna Convention needs updating\nDespite the Commission\u2019s enthusiasm, this isn\u2019t low-hanging fruit. It isn\u2019t only the EU that is causing regulatory uncertainty in this field. Globally, rules on driving are harmonised by the UN\u2019s 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.\nJoost Vantomme, smart mobility Director at the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA), said the rules need to be clarified. \u201cArticle eight says you need to have a driver in the vehicle, and they need to be in control of the vehicle,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what is a driver? Can it be a computer? And what does it mean to be in control of the vehicle?\u201d\nAs the technology for automated driving has called article eight into question, different countries have interpreted these rules differently. Antti Vehvil\u00e4inen, director-general of the Finnish Transport Agency, told the conference that Finland has chosen a loose interpretation. \u201cThe driver does not need to be in the car, he just needs to be in control,\u201d he said.\nThe EU\u2019s early efforts at clarification could mean that the bloc ends up setting the standards later adopted at the UN. It can take four to five years to modify a UN treaty, and work has not even begun yet.\nPublic worry\nBut is automated driving really the vote-winner that the Commission is imagining? There was much worry at the conference that fears over driverless cars are going to trump the benefits. What will someone think if they are driving on the motorway and see a driverless car next to them?\nIn Gothenburg Sweden, they\u2019re about to find out. Volvo is launching a project this year called DriveMe, which will put driverless vehicles on real roads with other drivers. The company wants to test how other drivers react, as well as other safety considerations.\nThe safety worries are a significant hurdle. At a special break-away panel dedicated to the human factors in CAD, most people agreed that people will over-trust automation and this could present dangers. Almost everyone agreed that operating an automated vehicle should require special training, and half said vehicles should alert others when they are in automated mode.\nThis will be a difficult question for regulators, Viegas admitted. \u201cA minister will know that giving approval today and then having a fatal accident tomorrow will result in him being fired,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to be able to guarantee that the automated vehicle would not fail in a scenario in which a human would not fail.\u201d\nStill, the mood at the Brussels conference was positive. There was a general consensus that, as long as safety concerns can be addressed, the EU is on to a winner by identifying autonomous vehicles as an area where it will demonstrate innovation leadership and quick regulatory adjustment.\n\u201cImagine on our roads trucks platooning with big signs saying \u2018Europe on the move\u2019,\u201d said Roberto Vavassori, president of the European automotive suppliers association CLEPA. \u201cIt would be a sign that EU legislation is there to improve quality of life for our people,\u201d he told the conference enthusiastically.\n\n\n\nAutonomous driving levels 0 to 5: Understanding the differences\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted the Society of Automotive Engineers' (SAE) levels for automated driving systems, ranging from complete driver control to full autonomy. \nBy Hope Reese | January 20, 20X-1, 10:47 AM PST \nBetween Tesla's announcement that every car in production will now have the capability for full autonomy by 20XX+1 and the Obama administration's plan to invest almost $4 billion in autonomous vehicle research over the next 10 years, the race to create the best driverless car has never been hotter.\nThe rise of driverless vehicles is going to have a major impact on businesses and professionals. Automated vehicles could replace corporate fleets for deliveries or transporting employees, for example. And workers could gain productive hours in the day by working instead of driving during daily commutes. Innovations in this field are also poised to completely change the car insurance industry by reducing accidents\u2014a new report predicts that accidents will drop by 80% by 20XX+20\nBut, what does \"autonomous driving\" really mean? The US Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defined five different levels of autonomous driving. In October 20XX-1, the NHTSA updated their policy to reflect that they have officially adopted the levels of autonomy outlined in the SAE International's J3016 document.\nThe NHTSA is \"working to transform government for the 21st century, harnessing innovation and technology that will improve people's lives,\" according to a representative. \"This is an area of rapid change, which requires the Department Of Transport and NHTSA to remain flexible and adaptable as new information and technologies emerge. Amid that rapid change, the North Star for Department Of Transport and NHTSA remains safety.\" \nIt's important to remember that the levels of autonomy describe the system, not the vehicle, said Bryant Walker Smith, professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law and School of Engineering and one of the top experts in the driverless cars world. \"A Level 5 automated driving system could be in a vehicle with or without a steering wheel,\" he explained.\nHere's what you need to know about levels 0-5. The biggest difference is that, starting at Level 3, the automated driving system becomes able to monitor the driving environment.\nLevel 0: This one is pretty basic. The driver (human) controls it all: steering, brakes, throttle, power. It's what you've been doing all along.\nLevel 1: This driver-assistance level means that most functions are still controlled by the driver, but a specific function (like steering or accelerating) can be done automatically by the car.\nLevel 2: In level 2, at least one driver assistance system of \"both steering and acceleration/ deceleration using information about the driving environment\" is automated, like cruise control and lane-centering. It means that the \"driver is disengaged from physically operating the vehicle by having his or her hands off the steering wheel AND foot off pedal at the same time,\" according to the SAE. The driver must still always be ready to take control of the vehicle, however. \nLevel 3: Drivers are still necessary in level 3 cars, but are able to completely shift \"safety-critical functions\" to the vehicle, under certain traffic or environmental conditions. It means that the driver is still present and will intervene if necessary, but is not required to monitor the situation in the same way it does for the previous levels. Jim McBride, autonomous vehicles expert at Ford, said this is \"the biggest demarcation is between Levels 3 and 4.\" He's focused on getting Ford straight to Level 4, since Level 3, which involves transferring control from car to human, can often pose difficulties. \"We're not going to ask the driver to instantaneously intervene\u2014that's not a fair proposition,\" McBride said.\nLevel 4: This is what is meant by \"fully autonomous.\" Level 4 vehicles are \"designed to perform all safety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip.\" However, it's important to note that this is limited to the \"operational design domain (ODD)\" of the vehicle - meaning it does not cover every driving scenario.\nLevel 5: This refers to a fully-autonomous system that expects the vehicle's performance to equal that of a human driver, in every driving scenario\u2014including extreme environments like dirt roads that are unlikely to be navigated by driverless vehicles in the near future. \nWhy it matters\nSo why are the levels important? They serve as general guidelines for how technologically advanced a vehicle is. In terms of what consumers need to know, Thilo Koslowski, former analyst for Gartner, thinks that ultimately, there are three stages that will be relevant: \"automated, autonomous, and driverless.\" It's important to distinguish between \"autonomous\" and \"driverless,\" he said: \"driverless is a more advanced stage of autonomous.\"\nBut while drivers themselves may be less concerned with the distinctions, the differences could be significant when it comes to issues like car insurance, which is expected to change radically in the era of self-driving cars. \nKPMG, a consulting firm, has issued a report on how the car insurance business will be affected, since the number of accidents are predicted to go down 80% over the coming 20 years. The different levels are important because they \"change the risk profile of the car,\" according to KPMG expert Jerry Albright. \"Insurance companies need to understand how these new capabilities affect driving risk.\" Joe Schneider, managing director at KPMG, put it this way: \"It's like a baby, going from crawling to walking to running.\" Albright said, \"The car becomes safer and safer as it moves towards fully-autonomous driving.\"\n\n\n\nStudy Service \n\nInternal Memo\n\nChallenges for automated vehicles in the EU\n\nThe potential impact of the deployment of automated vehicles raises many questions. The answers are still under discussion, having ethical, legal, financial, economic and technical dimensions. While most of the scientific discussion has to date dealt with the development of the technology, the focus recently is shifting towards topics such as user acceptance and legal issues. Policy makers, in particular, face challenges in designing the appropriate legal and regulatory framework so that new technologies are used properly and for the benefit of society.\n\nLegal framework for road safety\n\nRegulation of automated vehicles faces challenges to establish rules for technologies not yet applied. In particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed. Traffic rules and the regulatory framework need to be adapted. In addition, it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom. The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of driving education and licensing.\n\nInfrastructure and technical standards\n\nAutomated and connected vehicles need special features in infrastructure. What needs to be done at the infrastructure level has yet to be clarified. An important prerequisite for intelligent transport systems will be an agreement on what communication is needed between vehicles (V2V), between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) and vehicles to anyone else. Technical standardisation is necessary for international compatibility and interoperability.\n\nData processing\n\nThe new technologies raise questions as to how data privacy and cyber security will be addressed. The highly or fully automated vehicle will process data and make decisions: this raises ethical issues which have to be solved in a societal dialogue. The programmed algorithms will make decisions in conflicting situations, such as a choice between two unavoidable crash scenarios. How will the decision be taken? What 'best driving behaviour' should be reflected by the system?\n\nLiability issues\n\nIn case of malfunction of an automated vehicle, who is liable when such malfunctions result in an accident: the manufacturer, the owner or the driver has to be clarified.\n\n\n\n\nExamples for the different levels of automation\n\nLevel 0 - Park Distance Control (already deployed): The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals.\n\nLevel 1 - Park Assist (already deployed): The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces. The system assists the driver by automatically carrying out the optimum steering movements in order to reverse - park on the ideal line. The measurement of the parking space, the allocation of the starting position and the steering movements are automatically undertaken \u2013 all the driver has to do is operate the accelerator and the brake. This means that the driver retains control of the car at all times.\n\nLevel 2 - Traffic Jam Assist (already deployed): The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h). The system can be seen as an extension of the Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop&Go functionality, i.e. no lane change support.\n\nLevel 3 - Traffic Jam Chauffeur (already deployed): Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads. The system can be activated in a traffic jam scenario. It detects a slow-driving vehicle in front and then handles the vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Later versions of this functionality might include lane change functionality.\n\nLevel 4 - Highway Pilot (possible deployment 20XX+4): Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver must deliberately activate the system, but does not have to monitor it constantly. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. There is no request from the system to the driver to take over when the system is in its normal operation area on the motorway. Depending on the deployment of vehicle-to-vehicle communication and cooperative systems, ad-hoc convoys could also be created.\n\nLevel 5 \u2013 The fully automated vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger. According to ERTRAC only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10.\n\n\n\n\nSelf-driving cars could cost America's professional drivers up to 25,000 jobs a month, Goldman Sachs says\n\nAnita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan \nPublished 2:45 PM ET Mon, 22 May 20XX\nThe full impact of self-driving cars on society is several decades away \u2014 but when it hits, the job losses will be substantial for American truck drivers, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs. When autonomous vehicle saturation peaks, U.S. drivers could see job losses at a rate of 25,000 a month, or 300,000 a year, according to a report from Goldman Sachs Economics Research. Truck drivers, more so than bus or taxi drivers, will see the bulk of that job loss, according to the report. That makes sense, given today's employment: In 20XX-3, there were 4 million driver jobs in the U.S., 3.1 million of which were truck drivers, Goldman said. That represents 2 per cent of total employment. The report estimates that semi- and fully autonomous car sales will have about 20 per cent share of car sales around 20XX+10. The report comes as fierce competition to make self-driving cars is shaking up companies from the inside out. \nUber formally launched Uber Freight last week with a self-driving executive at the helm, expanding its reach in the trucking industry, even as it fights in court with Alphabet over whether some of its technology is stolen. And at Ford, the CEO will be replaced by a self-driving car expert, in an effort to \"transform Ford for the future.\" Near term, the analysts predict that occupations like secretaries, cashiers, bank tellers, waiters and real estate agents could also be at risk of automation.\nTo be sure, the report estimates that the full effects of self-driving cars will be delayed by regulation and slow adoption. The report as a whole strikes an optimistic tone on the future of the labor market, noting that many different employment and productivity measures in the United States do not show massive disruption from labor-replacing technologies. \nIndustries like department stores, telecom, printing, publishing and manufacturing have seen the biggest job losses over the past 13 years, while sectors like food services, education, computer design and home healthcare have been winners, the report said. \"Demand for health care, education and food services is likely to rise further with aggregate income, and should also benefit from broader trends including aging and consumers' desire for new experiences,\" the report said. \"More fundamentally, we suspect that several of the skills central to those sectors \u2014 including empathy, humor, creativity and problem solving \u2014 are hard to codify and automate.\"\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\nBriefing on driveless cars\nToday is 16 November 20XX\n \nIntroduction-Background information\nAutomated vehicle technologies allow the transfer of driving functions from a human driver to a computer. Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility and will create challenges. As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure. It has also the potential to be more environmentally friendly, efficient and accessible. However, automated vehicle technologies require an effective regulatory and legislative framework that can foster European leadership and competitiveness, while addressing a number of legitimate concerns.\n1. Potentials and challenges of vehicle automation\nThe potential impact of the deployment of automated vehicles has several aspects with technical, financial, economic, legal and ethical dimensions. \nDriverless cars will reform transportation as we know it by improoving our lives. Their adoption will slash accident and fatality rates, saving millions of lives. It will remove one-third to one-half of all vehicles from city streets because self-driving cars don\u2019t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers. \nEliminating human drivers will also allow automobile designers to build cars from a completely different mind set.The A.I. system driving the car will also reduce accidents to negligible levels. With no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient.\nFrom economic aspect, car sharing will cost a fraction of what car ownership today costs. Owning a car for daily, personal transportation will seem impractical while workers could gain productive hours in the day by working instead of driving during daily commutes.\nInnovations in this field are also poised to completely change the car insurance industry by reducing accidents\u2014a new report predicts that accidents will drop by 80% by 20XX+20\nAt the same time policy makers, face challenges in designing the appropriate legal and regulatory framework so that new technologies are used properly and for the benefit of society.\nThe rapid development of robots/automated cars might result in changes in the labour market through the creation, displacement and loss of certain jobs for example the replacement of corporate fleets for deliveries or transporting employees will push up the unemployment. \nLast but not least, the growing use of robotics  raises ethical issues concerning privacy and safety. The new technologies raise questions as to how data privacy and cyber security will be addressed. The highly or fully automated vehicle will process data and make decisions: this raises ethical issues which have to be solved in a societal dialogue. The programmed algorithms will make decisions in conflicting situations, such as a choice between two unavoidable crash scenarios. How will the decision be taken? What 'best driving behaviour' should be reflected by the system? A possible solution could be a voluntary ethical code of conduct on robotics for researchers and designers to ensure that they operate in accordance with legal and ethical standards and that robot design and use respect human dignity.\n2. The different levels of automation and their deployment\nBut, what does \"autonomous driving\" really mean? The US Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defined five different levels of autonomous driving.The levels are six (0-5).\nLevel 0 - Park Distance Control (already deployed): The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals.\nLevel 1 - Park Assist (already deployed): The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces. The system assists the driver by automatically carrying out the optimum steering movements in order to reverse - park on the ideal line. However, the driver has to operate the accelerator and the brake having the control of the car at all times.\nLevel 2 - Traffic Jam Assist (already deployed): The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h). The system can be seen as an extension of the Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop&Go functionality, i.e. no lane change support.\nLevel 3 - Traffic Jam Chauffeur (already deployed): Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads. The system can be activated in a traffic jam scenario. It detects a slow-driving vehicle in front and then handles the vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Later versions of this functionality might include lane change functionality.\nLevel 4 - Highway Pilot (possible deployment 20XX+4): Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver must deliberately activate the system, but does not have to monitor it constantly. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. There is no request from the system to the driver to take over when the system is in its normal operation area on the motorway. Depending on the deployment of vehicle-to-vehicle communication and cooperative systems, ad-hoc convoys could also be created.\nLevel 5 \u2013 The fully automated vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger. According to ERTRAC only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10.\n \n3. Regulatory and legal frameworks, state of play\nRoad traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness.\nOne of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept, as laid down in Article 8, that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic. The amended convention (20XX-1) still demands that every vehicle must have a driver. However, in the future it will be in accordance with the Convention that highly automated systems will have a driver who may take the hands off the wheel, but must be ready at all times to take over the driving functions, and who can override the system and switch it on and off. A further amendment process is therefore necessary to permit driverless vehicles. Systems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.\nThe regulatory environment relating to cyber security, data privacy, and liability issues is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles. Regulation of automated vehicles faces challenges to establish rules for technologies not yet applied. In particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed. Traffic rules and the regulatory framework need to be adapted. In addition, it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom. The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of driving education and licensing.\nEU Commission should be ready to propose rules on robotics and artificial intelligence, in order to fully exploit their economic potential and to guarantee a standard level of safety and security. As regulatory standards for robots are being planned in several countries, the EU needs to take the lead on setting these standards, so as not to be forced to follow those set by third countries.\nTraffic accidents have very large costs in economic terms, in particular regarding human lives or health, or regarding damage to an object. Liability law answers the question of who is responsible and who has to bear the costs of an accident. Relevant legislation is urgently needed to clarify liability issues, especially for self-driving cars. A mandatory insurance scheme and a supplementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driverless cars are fully compensated is needed. In addition, a specific legal status for robots in the long run, should be established in order to identify who is liable if they cause damage.\nRegarding ethics the creation of a European agency for robotics and artificial intelligence, to supply public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise should be considered.\n4.  Ongoing work in the EU\nIn the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products (Council Directive 85/374/EEC). A producer is liable for any damage caused by a defect in his product; a product is defective when it does not provide the safety which the consumer is entitled to expect. However, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved \u2014 the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States.\nSystems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.\nThe debate on data privacy regarding connected automated vehicles is evolving in parallel with the new technologies. In general, digital services will be available in vehicles, as they are anywhere else. As third parties can access and use sensitive driver and driving data, legislation seems necessary to protect personal privacy of consumers in connected vehicles.The new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regard to digital technologies, valid across the EU.\nThe EP resently (16-03-20xx) voted a resolution for the establishment of EU legislation for the fast-evolving field of robotics, e.g. to enforce ethical standards or establish liability for accidents involving driverless cars. In addition, the European Commission promised dedicated funding, regulatory changes, cross-border agreements and innovation stimulus. The first step in a roadmap, was published by the Commission as part of its transport strategy last May, that could see driverless cars integrated with traffic by 20XX+10.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 7.0\n\n"}]}

Automation, and in particular digitalisation, of driving will change road transport in a way which is viewed as a revolution in the field of mobility. As human error is the main reason for road traffic accidents, driving which is automatically controlled by a computer is expected to make future road transport safer and more secure. It has also the potential to be more environmentally friendly, efficient and accessible.

Their adoption will slash accident and fatality rates, saving millions of lives. As well, it will remove one-third to one-half of all vehicles from city streets. A large percentage of the cars on the streets of New York, San Francisco, and London at any one time are looking for parking; but self-driving cars don\u2019t need to park: they can continuously circulate, picking up and dropping off passengers.  The Earth Institute at Columbia University projects a 75 per cent reduction in the cost of car ownership, because fewer shared vehicles will be necessary to provide the same service collectively that personally owned vehicles provide. During peak hours, those shared vehicles will be in use 90 per cent of the time. And, with no more need for steering wheels and other systems enabling human control, vehicles will be lighter and far more fuel-efficient. \nMost important, car sharing will cost a fraction of what car ownership today costs. Owning a car for daily, personal transportation will seem impractical. Self-driving cars will also deliver incontrovertible social bene\ufb01ts. With self-driving cars, the disabled will no longer struggle to \ufb01nd transportation; they will have an on-demand personal driver. Several years ago Google\u2019s self-driving car team contacted Steve Mahan, Executive Director of the Santa Clara Valley Blind Center. The team wanted feedback and let Mahan come along for test-drives in earlier self-driving Prius models as well as in the latest Google car. \u201cMy experience with Google has been terri\ufb01c, and I want it to happen,\u201d Mahan told the Times. \u201cEveryone in the blind community wants it to happen.\u201d \nOther groups will also bene\ufb01t in tangible ways. Women and children will never worry about getting a cab ride late at night. Once all drivers are off the road, traf\ufb01c violations will no longer be an issue, and cops will have fewer reasons to pull over cars, which should reduce instances of the currently vicious discrimination against individuals \u201cdriving while black.\u201d Teens will not face insurance discrimination as they do today, and their parents will not have to pay for the dubious privilege of teaching a teenager to drive. People living in the country will \ufb01nally gain access to transportation services that put them nearly on par with their city cousins. Pedestrians will stop worrying about getting hit by cars in intersections.\nLet me paint a picture of what streets will look like in an age of driverless cars. We will no longer need traffic lights: robot cars will synchronize wirelessly to time mass movements across city intersections and entries onto freeways or balletic dances around four-way stop signs. Having no human eyes behind the wheel will obviate much of the need for signalling and signage. When all the driverless cars are talking to each other, there will be no need for them to ever come to a complete halt and waste all their kinetic energy. So we will be able to forget traffic lights\u2014and stop signs, yield signs, lighting on freeways, and dozens of other transportation-infrastructure elements catering to human drivers. This great elimination will save many, many billions of dollars in the United States. Equally important, self-driving cars will eliminate the need to build these types of infrastructure in less developed countries in which traffic lights, freeways, and other modern traf\ufb01c-control features have yet to be put in place. The future cost savings to those countries will be astronomical. In that future, the bene\ufb01ts of self-driving cars will be far more evenly distributed.\nEliminating human drivers will also allow automobile designers to build cars from a completely different mind set. Driverless cars will not need steering columns, brake pedals, accelerator pedals or any of the other components drivers use for slowing or accelerating. They will not need a gearshift panel in the middle of the driver compartment or an emergency brake pedal. The A.I. system driving the car will also reduce accidents to negligible levels. \n\u2026\n\n\n\n\nRobots and artificial intelligence: MEPs call for EU-wide liability rules\u00a0\n\nPress Releases\u00a0Plenary session\u00a0\n16-02-20XX - 13:09 \u00a0\n\n\nAs human-robot interactions become commonplace, MEPs stress that EU-wide rules are needed to guarantee a standard level of safety and security. \u00a9 AP Images/European Union - EP\n\nEU-wide rules are needed for the fast-evolving field of robotics, e.g. to enforce ethical standards or establish liability for accidents involving driverless cars, say MEPs in a resolution voted on Thursday. \nMEPs ask the EU Commission to propose rules on robotics and artificial intelligence, in order to fully exploit their economic potential and to guarantee a standard level of safety and security. They note that regulatory standards for robots are being planned in several countries, and point out that the EU needs to take the lead on setting these standards, so as not to be forced to follow those set by third countries.\nRapporteur Mady Delvaux (S&D, LU) said \u201cAlthough I am pleased that the plenary adopted my report on robotics, I am also disappointed that the right-wing coalition of ALDE, EPP and ECR refused to take account of possible negative consequences on the job market. They rejected an open-minded and forward-looking debate and thus disregarded the concerns of our citizens.\u201d\nLiability rules and the impact of robots on the workforce\nMEPs stress that draft legislation is urgently needed to clarify liability issues, especially for self-driving cars. They call for a mandatory insurance scheme and a supplementary fund to ensure that victims of accidents involving driverless cars are fully compensated.\nMEPs also ask the Commission to consider creating a specific legal status for robots in the long run, in order to establish who is liable if they cause damage.\nThe rapid development of robots might result in changes in the labour market through the creation, displacement and loss of certain jobs. MEPs urge the Commission to follow these trends closely.\nA Code of Ethical Conduct and a new European Agency for robotics\nThe growing use of robotics also raises ethical issues, for example to do with privacy and safety, stress MEPs. They propose a voluntary ethical code of conduct on robotics for researchers and designers to ensure that they operate in accordance with legal and ethical standards and that robot design and use respect human dignity.\nThey also ask the Commission to consider creating a European agency for robotics and artificial intelligence, to supply public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise.\nThe resolution was passed by 396 votes to 123, with 85 abstentions. The Commission will not be obliged to follow the Parliament\u2019s recommendations, but must state its reasons if it refuses.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n10-03-20XX\nRegulatory and legal framework for automated vehicles\nRoad traffic is a highly regulated area as it bears huge risks for all traffic users in public spaces. The automation of vehicles changes the driving risks in many regards and therefore requires an assessment of all traffic and vehicle related regulation. Different national jurisdictions can hinder the development and deployment of new technologies for systems or vehicles. European mobility requires a harmonised approach towards these new technologies, while fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation and jeopardise European competitiveness.\nRegulation of road traffic\nThe Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968 (\u2018Vienna Convention of 1968') is an international treaty designed to facilitate international road traffic and to increase road safety by establishing standard traffic rules among the contracting parties. All EU Member States are signatories of the Vienna Convention \u2014 only the UK and Spain have not ratified it. \nOne of the fundamental principles of the Vienna Convention is the concept, as laid down in Article 8, that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behaviour of a vehicle in traffic.\nThe amended convention (20XX-1) still demands that every vehicle must have a driver. However, in the future it will be in accordance with the Convention that highly automated systems will have a driver who may take the hands off the wheel, but must be ready at all times to take over the driving functions, and who can override the system and switch it on and off. A further amendment process is therefore necessary to permit driverless vehicles. Systems with high or full automation are mostly still incompatible with the Vienna Convention because a driver may not be required in these systems, depending on the use case.\nTechnical requirements\nTechnical requirements for vehicles are internationally harmonised in the framework of the two following UNECE Agreements:\nThe 1958 Agreement provides the framework for establishing international UN Regulations with uniform performance\u2014oriented test provisions and administrative procedures for granting type approvals, for the conformity of production and for the mutual recognition of the type approvals granted. The 1958 Agreement currently has 54 contracting parties and 135 annexed UN Regulations.\nThe 1998 Agreement concerns the establishing of global technical regulations for the construction of new vehicles, including performance requirements. Its purpose is to further enhance the process of international harmonisation through the development of global technical regulations (GTR). The 1998 Agreement has 35 Contracting Parties and 16 UN GTRs, established in the UN Global Registry (March 20XX-2).\nThe European Union is a contracting party to the 1958 and the 1998 Agreement. \nUnder the European vehicle type approval system, manufacturers can obtain approval for a new vehicle type in one EU Member State if it meets the EU technical requirements. The manufacturer can then market it EU\u2014wide with no need for further approval tests or checks in other Member States. The approval is granted by a national authority in charge of type approval. The completion of the type approval examination results in issuance of a Certificate of Conformity, which is a statement by the manufacturer that the vehicle conforms to the relevant legal requirements as stipulated by EU legislation.\nThe common legal framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers is provided by a Framework Directive. Within the EU, mass\u2014produced cars may only be used on public roads if they are type\u2014approved in compliance with the administrative procedures and technical requirements established by the Directive.\nGeneral regulatory environment\nThe regulatory environment relating to cyber security, data privacy, and liability issues is of particular importance in the development of automated vehicles.\nToday's connected vehicles are already equipped with extensive IT communication capabilities. In-vehicle networks for information and entertainment co-exist with automotive control networks. The different networks have different degrees of relevance for the safe functioning of the vehicle and for cyber security risks and data protection issues.\nAutomated vehicles are extended vehicles, meaning that they have external software and hardware extensions as some of their features. These extensions are developed, implemented and managed by the vehicle manufacturer. The connection between the in\u2014vehicle system and the manufacturer's central server has to be secure, so that all data transfers are protected from unauthorised disclosure and manipulation.\nUncontrolled, unrestricted access to vehicle data in the on-board network by third parties directly and indirectly jeopardises the safety of the vehicle, occupants and other road users. Media report increasingly on cyber security problems related to cars, for instance covering the successful attempt of hacking into a vehicle and controlling its basic driving functions via the entertainment and navigation software.\nThe debate on data privacy regarding connected automated vehicles is evolving in parallel with the new technologies. In general, digital services will be available in vehicles, as they are anywhere else. The \u2018connected car\u2018 has the capability to generate, store and transmit users\u2018 personal data, such as their route to work, time of driving, favourite music, appointments or favourite restaurants. These data have a significant potential for other uses. As third parties can access and use sensitive driver and driving data, legislation seems necessary to protect personal privacy of consumers in connected vehicles.\nThe new General Data Protection Regulation establishes a single set of rules on data protection, also with regard to digital technologies, valid across the EU.\nLiability issues\nTraffic accidents have very large costs in economic terms, in particular regarding human lives or health, or regarding damage to an object. Liability law answers the question of who is responsible and who has to bear the costs of an accident.\nIn the European Union product liability is strongly harmonised by the Directive on liability for defective products (Council Directive 85/374/EEC). A producer is liable for any damage caused by a defect in his product; a product is defective when it does not provide the safety which the consumer is entitled to expect.\nHowever, there is currently no framework in place harmonising the rules on liability for damages caused by accidents in which motor vehicles are involved \u2014 the regulation of liability of the holder of a vehicle or of the driver differ between the Member States.\nMost liability regimes in the EU use a concept of causality for determining and allocating liability. From a certain level of vehicle automation on, it might be difficult to establish the exact cause of an accident and to prove if it is due to a defect with the automated vehicle or the behaviour of the driver. The new possible causes created by automation might interfere with the very objective of liability regimes to apportion risks, therefore an adaptation of liability law to the new technologies and a European harmonisation of the regimes concerning the liability of owners and/or drivers of automated vehicles seem necessary.\n\n \n\n\nEU Commission drives home merits of autonomous vehicles\nBy Dave Keating | EURACTIV.com \n\u00a0Apr 6, 20XX\n\nCan driverless cars chauffeur people to a love of the EU? The European Commission is betting it can.\nChristmas came early for automated driving enthusiasts this week. Convening a two-day summit in Brussels on the subject \u2013 the first of its kind \u2013 the European Commission promised a sack of goodies in the form of dedicated funding, regulatory changes, cross-border agreements and innovation stimulus.\nDriverless trucks could be a reality on European motorways within two years, officials said. They would first operate in convoys where the first truck is driven by a human being but all the trucks following are driverless.\nIt\u2019s the first step in a roadmap, to be published by the Commission as part of its transport strategy on 31 May, that could see driverless cars integrated with traffic by 20XX+10.\n\u201cOwning a non-autonomous car will soon be like owning a horse,\u201d said Carlos Moedas, the EU commissioner for research, science and innovation, who spoke at the conference.\nCommission President Jean-Claude Juncker has identified driverless vehicles as an area where the EU can deliver tangible benefits to citizens. In his five-scenario white paper on the future of Europe, released last month ahead of the EU\u2019s 60th anniversary summit in Rome, connected and autonomous driving (CAD) was used repeatedly as an example of something that cannot become a reality without the EU.\nIn a scenario in which the EU downgrades to only a free trade zone, \u201cEuropeans are reluctant to use connected cars due to the absence of EU-wide rules and technical standards,\u201d the paper concluded.\nThree weeks later, national leaders signed an agreement in Rome to not only allow cross-border tests and experiments but also to establish one single point of contact in each country to approve them.\nHighway cruising\nTrucks are expected to be the first to go driverless, both because they drive on motorways and because they are the most commercially interesting. Though convoys following a lead driven vehicle will be the first step, the next step will be completely independent automated trucks.\nMotorways present the safest environment for CAD because they are free of pedestrians and are more or less in a straight line. They are also more uniform throughout Europe. In the very near future trucks will be driven within cities by a driver, but then dropped off at the motorway to continue its journey alone. When the truck arrives at its destination, a new driver would pick it up at the motorway exit.\n\u201cLisbon to Warsaw today is four and a half days, but that could be brought down to one and a half,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Manuel Viegas, secretary-general of the International Transport Forum at the OECD, told euractiv.com.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very useful for trucks and buses not only because it would save on labour costs and operation, but because it could operate 24 hours a day.\u201d \nSemi-autonomous \u2018platoons\u2019 of trucks from around Europe will travel to Rotterdam in early April as part of an experiment backed by the Dutch Council presidency.\nVienna Convention needs updating\nDespite the Commission\u2019s enthusiasm, this isn\u2019t low-hanging fruit. It isn\u2019t only the EU that is causing regulatory uncertainty in this field. Globally, rules on driving are harmonised by the UN\u2019s 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.\nJoost Vantomme, smart mobility Director at the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA), said the rules need to be clarified. \u201cArticle eight says you need to have a driver in the vehicle, and they need to be in control of the vehicle,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what is a driver? Can it be a computer? And what does it mean to be in control of the vehicle?\u201d\nAs the technology for automated driving has called article eight into question, different countries have interpreted these rules differently. Antti Vehvil\u00e4inen, director-general of the Finnish Transport Agency, told the conference that Finland has chosen a loose interpretation. \u201cThe driver does not need to be in the car, he just needs to be in control,\u201d he said.\nThe EU\u2019s early efforts at clarification could mean that the bloc ends up setting the standards later adopted at the UN. It can take four to five years to modify a UN treaty, and work has not even begun yet.\nPublic worry\nBut is automated driving really the vote-winner that the Commission is imagining? There was much worry at the conference that fears over driverless cars are going to trump the benefits. What will someone think if they are driving on the motorway and see a driverless car next to them?\nIn Gothenburg Sweden, they\u2019re about to find out. Volvo is launching a project this year called DriveMe, which will put driverless vehicles on real roads with other drivers. The company wants to test how other drivers react, as well as other safety considerations.\nThe safety worries are a significant hurdle. At a special break-away panel dedicated to the human factors in CAD, most people agreed that people will over-trust automation and this could present dangers. Almost everyone agreed that operating an automated vehicle should require special training, and half said vehicles should alert others when they are in automated mode.\nThis will be a difficult question for regulators, Viegas admitted. \u201cA minister will know that giving approval today and then having a fatal accident tomorrow will result in him being fired,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to be able to guarantee that the automated vehicle would not fail in a scenario in which a human would not fail.\u201d\nStill, the mood at the Brussels conference was positive. There was a general consensus that, as long as safety concerns can be addressed, the EU is on to a winner by identifying autonomous vehicles as an area where it will demonstrate innovation leadership and quick regulatory adjustment.\n\u201cImagine on our roads trucks platooning with big signs saying \u2018Europe on the move\u2019,\u201d said Roberto Vavassori, president of the European automotive suppliers association CLEPA. \u201cIt would be a sign that EU legislation is there to improve quality of life for our people,\u201d he told the conference enthusiastically.\n\n\n\nAutonomous driving levels 0 to 5: Understanding the differences\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted the Society of Automotive Engineers' (SAE) levels for automated driving systems, ranging from complete driver control to full autonomy. \nBy Hope Reese | January 20, 20X-1, 10:47 AM PST \nBetween Tesla's announcement that every car in production will now have the capability for full autonomy by 20XX+1 and the Obama administration's plan to invest almost $4 billion in autonomous vehicle research over the next 10 years, the race to create the best driverless car has never been hotter.\nThe rise of driverless vehicles is going to have a major impact on businesses and professionals. Automated vehicles could replace corporate fleets for deliveries or transporting employees, for example. And workers could gain productive hours in the day by working instead of driving during daily commutes. Innovations in this field are also poised to completely change the car insurance industry by reducing accidents\u2014a new report predicts that accidents will drop by 80% by 20XX+20\nBut, what does \"autonomous driving\" really mean? The US Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) defined five different levels of autonomous driving. In October 20XX-1, the NHTSA updated their policy to reflect that they have officially adopted the levels of autonomy outlined in the SAE International's J3016 document.\nThe NHTSA is \"working to transform government for the 21st century, harnessing innovation and technology that will improve people's lives,\" according to a representative. \"This is an area of rapid change, which requires the Department Of Transport and NHTSA to remain flexible and adaptable as new information and technologies emerge. Amid that rapid change, the North Star for Department Of Transport and NHTSA remains safety.\" \nIt's important to remember that the levels of autonomy describe the system, not the vehicle, said Bryant Walker Smith, professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law and School of Engineering and one of the top experts in the driverless cars world. \"A Level 5 automated driving system could be in a vehicle with or without a steering wheel,\" he explained.\nHere's what you need to know about levels 0-5. The biggest difference is that, starting at Level 3, the automated driving system becomes able to monitor the driving environment.\nLevel 0: This one is pretty basic. The driver (human) controls it all: steering, brakes, throttle, power. It's what you've been doing all along.\nLevel 1: This driver-assistance level means that most functions are still controlled by the driver, but a specific function (like steering or accelerating) can be done automatically by the car.\nLevel 2: In level 2, at least one driver assistance system of \"both steering and acceleration/ deceleration using information about the driving environment\" is automated, like cruise control and lane-centering. It means that the \"driver is disengaged from physically operating the vehicle by having his or her hands off the steering wheel AND foot off pedal at the same time,\" according to the SAE. The driver must still always be ready to take control of the vehicle, however. \nLevel 3: Drivers are still necessary in level 3 cars, but are able to completely shift \"safety-critical functions\" to the vehicle, under certain traffic or environmental conditions. It means that the driver is still present and will intervene if necessary, but is not required to monitor the situation in the same way it does for the previous levels. Jim McBride, autonomous vehicles expert at Ford, said this is \"the biggest demarcation is between Levels 3 and 4.\" He's focused on getting Ford straight to Level 4, since Level 3, which involves transferring control from car to human, can often pose difficulties. \"We're not going to ask the driver to instantaneously intervene\u2014that's not a fair proposition,\" McBride said.\nLevel 4: This is what is meant by \"fully autonomous.\" Level 4 vehicles are \"designed to perform all safety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip.\" However, it's important to note that this is limited to the \"operational design domain (ODD)\" of the vehicle - meaning it does not cover every driving scenario.\nLevel 5: This refers to a fully-autonomous system that expects the vehicle's performance to equal that of a human driver, in every driving scenario\u2014including extreme environments like dirt roads that are unlikely to be navigated by driverless vehicles in the near future. \nWhy it matters\nSo why are the levels important? They serve as general guidelines for how technologically advanced a vehicle is. In terms of what consumers need to know, Thilo Koslowski, former analyst for Gartner, thinks that ultimately, there are three stages that will be relevant: \"automated, autonomous, and driverless.\" It's important to distinguish between \"autonomous\" and \"driverless,\" he said: \"driverless is a more advanced stage of autonomous.\"\nBut while drivers themselves may be less concerned with the distinctions, the differences could be significant when it comes to issues like car insurance, which is expected to change radically in the era of self-driving cars. \nKPMG, a consulting firm, has issued a report on how the car insurance business will be affected, since the number of accidents are predicted to go down 80% over the coming 20 years. The different levels are important because they \"change the risk profile of the car,\" according to KPMG expert Jerry Albright. \"Insurance companies need to understand how these new capabilities affect driving risk.\" Joe Schneider, managing director at KPMG, put it this way: \"It's like a baby, going from crawling to walking to running.\" Albright said, \"The car becomes safer and safer as it moves towards fully-autonomous driving.\"\n\n\n\nStudy Service \n\nInternal Memo\n\nChallenges for automated vehicles in the EU\n\nThe potential impact of the deployment of automated vehicles raises many questions. The answers are still under discussion, having ethical, legal, financial, economic and technical dimensions. While most of the scientific discussion has to date dealt with the development of the technology, the focus recently is shifting towards topics such as user acceptance and legal issues. Policy makers, in particular, face challenges in designing the appropriate legal and regulatory framework so that new technologies are used properly and for the benefit of society.\n\nLegal framework for road safety\n\nRegulation of automated vehicles faces challenges to establish rules for technologies not yet applied. In particular, appropriate safety requirements have to be agreed. Traffic rules and the regulatory framework need to be adapted. In addition, it has to be decided how the safety of automated vehicles should be tested and by whom. The further development of vehicle automation will demand an adaption of driving education and licensing.\n\nInfrastructure and technical standards\n\nAutomated and connected vehicles need special features in infrastructure. What needs to be done at the infrastructure level has yet to be clarified. An important prerequisite for intelligent transport systems will be an agreement on what communication is needed between vehicles (V2V), between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I) and vehicles to anyone else. Technical standardisation is necessary for international compatibility and interoperability.\n\nData processing\n\nThe new technologies raise questions as to how data privacy and cyber security will be addressed. The highly or fully automated vehicle will process data and make decisions: this raises ethical issues which have to be solved in a societal dialogue. The programmed algorithms will make decisions in conflicting situations, such as a choice between two unavoidable crash scenarios. How will the decision be taken? What 'best driving behaviour' should be reflected by the system?\n\nLiability issues\n\nIn case of malfunction of an automated vehicle, who is liable when such malfunctions result in an accident: the manufacturer, the owner or the driver has to be clarified.\n\n\n\n\nExamples for the different levels of automation\n\nLevel 0 - Park Distance Control (already deployed): The system assists the driver to manoeuvre into tight spaces by communicating distance from obstacles by means of acoustic or optical signals.\n\nLevel 1 - Park Assist (already deployed): The system automatically steers the car into parallel and bay parking spaces, and also out of parallel parking spaces. The system assists the driver by automatically carrying out the optimum steering movements in order to reverse - park on the ideal line. The measurement of the parking space, the allocation of the starting position and the steering movements are automatically undertaken \u2013 all the driver has to do is operate the accelerator and the brake. This means that the driver retains control of the car at all times.\n\nLevel 2 - Traffic Jam Assist (already deployed): The function controls the vehicle longitudinally to follow the traffic flow in low speeds (lower than 30 km/h). The system can be seen as an extension of the Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop&Go functionality, i.e. no lane change support.\n\nLevel 3 - Traffic Jam Chauffeur (already deployed): Conditional Automated Driving up to 60 km/h on motorways or similar roads. The system can be activated in a traffic jam scenario. It detects a slow-driving vehicle in front and then handles the vehicle both longitudinally and laterally. Later versions of this functionality might include lane change functionality.\n\nLevel 4 - Highway Pilot (possible deployment 20XX+4): Automated driving up to 130 km/h on motorways or motorway-like roads from entrance to exit, on all lanes, including overtaking movements. The driver must deliberately activate the system, but does not have to monitor it constantly. The driver can override or switch off the system at all times. There is no request from the system to the driver to take over when the system is in its normal operation area on the motorway. Depending on the deployment of vehicle-to-vehicle communication and cooperative systems, ad-hoc convoys could also be created.\n\nLevel 5 \u2013 The fully automated vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to point B, without any input from the passenger. According to ERTRAC only a rough estimation for possible deployment can be given: 20XX+10.\n\n\n\n\nSelf-driving cars could cost America's professional drivers up to 25,000 jobs a month, Goldman Sachs says\n\nAnita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan \nPublished 2:45 PM ET Mon, 22 May 20XX\nThe full impact of self-driving cars on society is several decades away \u2014 but when it hits, the job losses will be substantial for American truck drivers, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs. When autonomous vehicle saturation peaks, U.S. drivers could see job losses at a rate of 25,000 a month, or 300,000 a year, according to a report from Goldman Sachs Economics Research. Truck drivers, more so than bus or taxi drivers, will see the bulk of that job loss, according to the report. That makes sense, given today's employment: In 20XX-3, there were 4 million driver jobs in the U.S., 3.1 million of which were truck drivers, Goldman said. That represents 2 per cent of total employment. The report estimates that semi- and fully autonomous car sales will have about 20 per cent share of car sales around 20XX+10. The report comes as fierce competition to make self-driving cars is shaking up companies from the inside out. \nUber formally launched Uber Freight last week with a self-driving executive at the helm, expanding its reach in the trucking industry, even as it fights in court with Alphabet over whether some of its technology is stolen. And at Ford, the CEO will be replaced by a self-driving car expert, in an effort to \"transform Ford for the future.\" Near term, the analysts predict that occupations like secretaries, cashiers, bank tellers, waiters and real estate agents could also be at risk of automation.\nTo be sure, the report estimates that the full effects of self-driving cars will be delayed by regulation and slow adoption. The report as a whole strikes an optimistic tone on the future of the labor market, noting that many different employment and productivity measures in the United States do not show massive disruption from labor-replacing technologies. \nIndustries like department stores, telecom, printing, publishing and manufacturing have seen the biggest job losses over the past 13 years, while sectors like food services, education, computer design and home healthcare have been winners, the report said. \"Demand for health care, education and food services is likely to rise further with aggregate income, and should also benefit from broader trends including aging and consumers' desire for new experiences,\" the report said. \"More fundamentally, we suspect that several of the skills central to those sectors \u2014 including empathy, humor, creativity and problem solving \u2014 are hard to codify and automate.\"\n\nTrainee's Answer: \nTrainee's Answer\n16 November 20XX\nDear Elon,\nPlease find below the briefing concerning driverless cars for this week Unit meeting. Here are summarized potentials and challenges of vehicle automation, the different levels of automation and their deployment. I have also made an overview of current regulatory and legal frameworks, and the ongoing work in the EU.\n \nDigitalisation of driving is the future of mobility. Automated vehicle could make road transport safer and more secure. Driving automation technologies would be more eco-friendly, efficient and accessible. Thus it requires adequate regulations and legal framework to overcome challenges for an efficient use of the technologies.\n1.POTENTIALS AND CHALLENGES OF VEHICLE AUTOMATION\nVehicle automation is the key future in transport development. Many benefits could result in implementing driving digitalisation while some challenges and questions still need to be addressed. \nPOTENTIALS\nUsing driverles cars is first money saving. It could remove to one-half of all vehicles from the streets allowing 70 % cost reduction of car ownership via shared automated vehicles.Less infrastructures buildings will be needed, that reduces expenses linked to traffic equipments (signage, traffic lights etc.).\nThis could lead to social benefits at it could ease acces to transport for specific groups of people: disable person, women or person living outside cities could have on-demand personal transportation. \nRoads will become safer as the number of streets accidents should drop due to traffic reduction. \nDiscrimation against individuals ( police intervention in traffic violations) and insurance discrimination could be impacted positively.\nThe use of driverless will also be eco-friendly as traffic will be reduced due to more automated car sharing offer and there will be more energy saving with no more use of public lights for instance. The resulting changes in car equipments and design will make vehicles lighter and more fuel-efficient e.g. no more brake pedals or steering wheels.\nCHALLENGES\nThere are unresolved issues related to ethics i.e human dignity respect, privacy and safety worries like the control of the vehicle in emergency case.\nAnother concern is the lack of regulation or rules to clarify liabilty matters for accidents involving driverless car. There is an absense of EU-wide rules and technical standards in these subjects.\nPeople also worry about potential negative impact on the labour market:  loss of certain jobs due to automation e.g. for professional drivers.\nThere are still questions on cyber security risks and data protection issues related to connected automated vehicle.\n2. THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTOMATION AND THEIR DEPLOYMENT\nIt is important to clarify the meaning of \"autonomous driving\". The NHTSA defined the five levels of autonomy describing the IT system in vehicles. They are:\nLevel 0: fully control by human.This is already deployed e.g. Park Distance Control.\nLevel 1: a specific function are done automatically by the car. This is already deployed e.g. Park Assist.\nLevel 2: at least one driver assistance system is automated. This is already deployed e.g. Traffic Jam Assist.\nLevel 3: safety-critical functions can be completly shifted to the vehicle (under certain traffic and environmental conditions). This is already deployed e.g. Traffic Jam Chauffeur.\nLevel 4: \"fully autonomous\" i.e. vehicles are designed to perform all safety critical driving functions and monitor roadway condition for an entire trip. This does not cover all driving scenario. This is could be deployed by 20XX+4 e.g. Higway Pilot.\nLevel 5: fully-autonomous system i.e. vehicles' performance ishould equal that of a human driver in every driving scenario. This is could be deployed by 20XX+10 e.g. \"The fully automated vehicle\".\n3. REGULATORY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK, STATE OF PLAY\nTo answer challenges related to the use of automated vehicles, the European Commission already set in place a number of regulations.\nThe Vienna convention on Road Traffic of 1968 signed by all members states (in exception of Spain, an international treaty, establishes standard traffic rules among the contracting parties. But the convention and its amendment still demand that all vehicle must have a driver to take over the driving control in emergency cases. Thus high or full automation of vehicle are incompatibe with the Vienna convention.\nThe EU is a contracting party to the 1958 and the 1998 UNECE Agreements providing international harmonised framework in technical requirements for vehicles. The 1958 agreement, the EU vehicle type approval system granted by a national authority provides a Certificate of Conformity respecting legal requirements stipulated by the EU legislation.The Framework Directive of the 1998 Agreement establishes procedures and technical requirements for cars to be used on public roads.\nThe New General Data Protection Regulation establishes set of rules on data protection across the EU to ensure unauthorised disclosure and manipulation of automated vehicle data.\nWithin the EU there is no common harmonised rules on liabilty for damages caused by accidents involving motor vehicle. An adaption of liabilty law and a European harmonisation of the regimes concerning the liabilty of owners and/or drivers of automated vehicles is necessary.\n4.ONGOING WORK IN THE EU\nThe commission is still working on main issues related to automated vehicle in the EU. The legal framework for road safety has to be adapted. There is also a need to redefine infrastructure and technical standards. Reflection on questions concerning data processing and liabilty are as well underway.\nOn 16 February, MEPs proposed to the commision a code of Ethical conduct to ensure legal and ethical standards application and human dignity respect. MEPS stressed the need to draft legislation concerning liabiliites issues for selfdriving cars and to follow closely the impact of robots development on the labor market. It also suggests the creation of a European agency for robotics and artificial intelligence to supply public authorities with technical, ethical and regulatory expertise.\nDriverless cars integrated with traffic by 20XX+10 is part of the Commission transport strategy. Trucks are expected to go first driverless in motorways. As part of an experiment semi-autonomous platoons of trucks from around Europe started travelling to Rotterdam in early April.\n \nMany advantages can be considered in vehicle automation as the key future in transport development. Lot of  benefits can result in implementing driving digitalisation like money and energy saving or improvement in transportation availabilty. However some challenges and questions still need to be addressed.The commission is still working on main issues related to automated vehicle in the EU: The legal framework and standards. Reflection on questions concerning data processing and liabilty are also underway.\n \nI hope this will be usefull and clear for the colleagues.\nPlease get back to me if you have comments or think that further information should be added.\nThank you.\nRegards,\nXXX\nEconomist officer - DG mobility and transport\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Communication Score (out-off 10): 5.0\n\n"}]}
